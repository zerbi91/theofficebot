1
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,398
- Michael !
- Oh god, Dwight come on !

2
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:39,884
I wanted to talk to you
about the downsizing.

3
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:41,369
There's no downsizing.

4
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,042
But if there were, I'd be protected
as assistant regional manager ?

5
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:47,070
- Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
- Yeah, so I don't have to worry ?

6
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:49,627
Look look look, I talked to corporate,

7
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:52,397
About protecting the sales staff and
they said they couldn't guarantee it

8
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:55,936
If there's downsizing. Ok ?
But, there's no downsizing.

9
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,628
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried ?

10
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,662
Maybe.

11
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:03,412
<i>It looks like there's
gonna be downsizing.</i>

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,292
That is part of my job, but...

13
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,061
I hate it

14
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:11,128
I think the main difference
between me and Donald Trump

15
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:15,687
Is that I get no pleasure out of
saying the words "you're fired"

16
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:18,508
"You're fired", "you're fired".

17
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:20,701
He just makes people sad.

18
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:22,887
And an office can't function that way.

19
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:24,864
No way. "You're fired".

20
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:27,341
I think that if I had a
catch phrase it would be,

21
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:30,656
"you're hired, and you can work
here as long as you want".

22
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,736
But that's unrealistic so...

23
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:37,910
<i>It's a real shame,</i>

24
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:40,663
<i>cause studies have shown that more
information get passed through,</i>

25
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:42,738
<i>water cooler gossips than
through official memos,</i>

26
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:46,483
Which puts me in a disadvantage because

27
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,162
I bring my own water to work.

28
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,108
- Why did you do this ?
- I didn't do it.

29
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,522
What do you mean ?

30
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:56,976
The water cooler was
brought over here for...

31
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,712
Maintenance.

32
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:00,776
So why are you guys here ?

33
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:03,240
What's the schedule bud'?

34
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:08,381
Gets that, for operation
moral improvement,

35
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,451
Starring Michael Scott.

36
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:12,840
Now I think I had a
little stroke of genius,

37
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:15,612
in that I have had
my assistant Pam,

38
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:19,162
smile Pam, I have had her go out
and find out whose birthday,

39
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:22,463
is coming up, so we can
have a little celebration for it.

40
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:24,641
Not bad, not bad at all, all right.

41
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,464
And the birthday person is :
Drum roll please....

42
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:38,199
who is it ?
Whose the birthday ?

43
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,702
Actually we don't have any
staff birthdays coming up.

44
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:44,433
- Next person on the calendar.
- Ok.

45
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,049
- That would be Meredith.
- Yes all right.

46
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:51,720
- Come on down Meredith !
- But it's not until next month.

47
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,435
Ok.

48
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,329
Great ! you know, it will be a surprise.

49
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:01,011
- You still want to have a party ?
- Yeah why not, sure,

50
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:03,140
go ahead ! Lead a little.
Come on Pam.

51
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,725
Come on shake it up, shake it in.

52
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:07,654
Shake it up.

53
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:13,114
Spok, is there any signs
of life down there ?

54
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,937
Well, let me check captain.

55
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:22,181
No captain no signs of life down there.

56
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:25,230
Just a wet blanket, named Pam.

57
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:31,519
Star Trek.

58
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:34,828
Well for decorations maybe we could...

59
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:37,818
- Stupid forget it.
- What ?

60
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:41,279
I was just gonna say maybe
we could have streamers but,

61
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,172
that's dumb. Everybody have streamers.

62
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:46,375
- Never mind
- No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.

63
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,766
What color do you guys think ?

64
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,497
Well there's green.

65
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:53,778
Blue.

66
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,505
Yellow.

67
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:57,878
- Red.
- How about green ?

68
00:03:58,553 --> 00:04:00,482
I think green is kind of whorish.

69
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,286
<i>This was tough.</i>

70
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:04,389
I suggested we flip a coin.

71
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,177
But Angela said she
doesn't like to gamble.

72
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:11,180
Of course by saying that she was
gambling that I wouldn't smack her.

73
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:15,193
These are my party
planning biatches,

74
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,682
Pulled off an amazing
eighties party last year.

75
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:19,524
"Off the hook" !

76
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:22,805
<i>So I was thinking, if you
haven't already got the cake...</i>

77
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:25,620
Maybe going for one of those ice
cream cakes from Baskin Robbins...

78
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,521
they're very good. Very delicious.

79
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:29,720
Meredith is allergic to dairy so...

80
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,860
She's not the only one
that's gonna be eating right ?

81
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:34,968
I think everybody likes ice cream cake.

82
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,045
It's not, not just about her so...

83
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:40,283
- It's her birthday.
- Milk chocolate chip !

84
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:41,681
Would be good.

85
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,996
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that
it might be a good idea...

86
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,706
if you and I formed an alliance.

87
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,584
Because of the downsizing.

88
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,503
I think an alliance
might be a good idea.

89
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,298
You know, help each other out.

90
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:05,044
Do you want to form an alliance ?

91
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:07,359
With me ?

92
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:11,627
- Absolutely I do.
- Good, good.

93
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,449
Excellent, ok, now we need
to figure out who's vulnerable...

94
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,078
who's protected the...

95
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:18,254
<i>At that moment I was just so happy.</i>

96
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,032
I mean everything Dwight does,
annoys me.

97
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:23,155
Did you get your tickets ?

98
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:24,775
To what ?

99
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:26,685
The gun show.

100
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:33,987
And I spend...

101
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:36,418
hours thinking of ways
to get back at him...

102
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:38,916
but only ways that would get me arrested.

103
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:43,276
Then here he comes and
he says "no, Jim, here's a way".

104
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,493
Just one other thing
and this is important.

105
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:48,606
Let's keep this alliance
totally a secret.

106
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:50,265
Yeah.

107
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,271
Don't tell anyone.

108
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,220
- An alliance ?
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:55,678
What does that even mean ?

110
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:58,416
I think it has something to do with
"survivor", but I'm not sure.

111
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:04,213
I know that it involves spying on
people and we may build a fort, Pam.

112
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,519
Jim ? Hey, Hi Pam.

113
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:10,590
Can I talk to you a second
about the paper products ?

114
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,358
- Did you tell Pam about the alliance ?
- No !

115
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,036
- Just now !
- Oh no, no, no !

116
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,255
Dwight no. I'm using her...

117
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:20,313
for the alliance, who knows the
most information about this office ?

118
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,442
- Pam ! Right.
- That's good, good, pursue this !

119
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,663
I'm trying to,.
Do you see what I'm doing ?

120
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,824
But listen, I'm gonna have
to talk to her a lot.

121
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,534
All right, there might
chatting, and giggling,

122
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,025
And you got to just pretend
to ignore it, wipe it away.

123
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:33,961
Done !
All right.

124
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,801
Can you get her, she's right there.
That is Meredith.

125
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,116
The birthday girl.

126
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:47,068
And this...

127
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,563
Is Meredith card. "Happy Bird-day."

128
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,329
Let's see... Jim.

129
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:59,094
Jim wrote : "Meredith I heard you're
turning forty-six but come on...

130
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:01,882
You're an accountant,
just fudge the numbers"

131
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,061
Not bad, pretty funny.

132
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:06,719
I don't appreciate condoning
corporate fraud though.

133
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:10,163
Here's the thing,
whatever I write here...

134
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:13,144
has to be really really funny.

135
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,507
Because people out
there are expecting it.

136
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,034
I've already set the bar really high.

137
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,426
<i>And they're all worried
about their jobs,</i>

138
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,361
<i>you know, it's kind of dark out there.</i>

139
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:25,027
<i>Can you imagine
if I wrote something like :</i>

140
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:28,133
"Meredith, happy birthday...

141
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,029
you're great, love Michael".

142
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,415
They seem awfully chummy.
Don't you think ?

143
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,759
Yeah, what do you think that's about ?

144
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,151
Only one way to find out.

145
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:47,331
Come on.

146
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:52,415
- You are not going to believe this.
- What ? I believe it.

147
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:55,608
- Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
- I can tell from the body language.

148
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:58,550
- That looks good, what is it, turkey ?
- Italian.

149
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,589
Oh Italian ! Nice. Wow.

150
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:05,148
Get the works there.
Red onion, provolone...

151
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,064
Yeah.

152
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,582
<i>Toby and Kevin, they're trying
to get Angela kicked off.</i>

153
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,436
Good ! Let them,
That's fine it helps our cause.

154
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,222
Well I don't know.
Because if Kevin is in accounting...

155
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:16,261
and Toby is in human resources...
and they're talking ?

156
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:17,471
They're forming an alliance.

157
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,753
- I love their sandwich.
- I love their sandwich too.

158
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:22,815
- Their bread is really good.
- Their bread is very good.

159
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:25,053
Damn it ! God !

160
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,484
God !

161
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,931
Ok, listen.

162
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:35,421
We need to assume that everyone
in the office is forming an alliance.

163
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:37,285
And is therefore trying
to get us kicked out.

164
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:39,773
Damn it, why us ?

165
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:42,484
Because we're strong Dwight,
because we're strong.

166
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:44,791
Meredith, Meredith...

167
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:47,153
"Mary had a little lamb"...

168
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,617
Meredith had a little lamb,

169
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:52,198
don't bring that lamb to work
or it'll poop on the floor...

170
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,716
Hey ! Oscar ! Come on in. What's up ?

171
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,189
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- No not at all come on in.

172
00:08:57,232 --> 00:09:00,435
- What's going on ?
- My nephew is involved with...

173
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:03,444
With charity for Cerebral Palsy,

174
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,952
And I was wondering
if maybe you would like to.

175
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,444
- You know, if...
- What ?

176
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:11,180
A donate to the charity.

177
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:13,245
Oh God !'Course I would.

178
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:16,669
Get it over here ! Get that over here.

179
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,206
- Thank you.
- No I'm always good...

180
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,470
For some serious buckage.
Wow ! Two dollars, three dollars ?

181
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,846
People out here, do not care about...

182
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:28,910
diseases.

183
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:32,325
I'm going to give you
twenty five dollars.

184
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:35,562
That's...

185
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,302
- That's, that's very generous.
- Oh my gosh, well.

186
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:42,932
Listen Oscar, generosity and
togetherness, and community...

187
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:46,600
all convalescences into...

188
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:48,973
Moral.

189
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:51,355
That's what I say, so...

190
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,085
- Hey Jim, can I talk to you for second ?
- Sure, what's up ?

191
00:09:58,203 --> 00:10:00,538
I don't know I'm just
going a little crazy...

192
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:03,258
cause I keep overhearing
all these conversations...

193
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:07,744
between Michael and
corporate about like staff issues.

194
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:10,714
- Oh no !
- Yeah. He's making me take notes

195
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:14,129
on his meetings, and I'm like,
these people are my friends.

196
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:15,653
- Right.
- But he's all like

197
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,286
this is confidential you
can't tell anybody but..."

198
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,978
I don't know I just
feel like I want to...

199
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,271
Just promise me you're
gonna say anything.

200
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,736
- I will not. I'm not gonna tell anybody
- Ok.

201
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,725
- It's between you and me.
- Yeah.

202
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:33,166
Jackpot.

203
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,587
<i>That was beautiful.
All her idea, too.</i>

204
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:37,676
Awesome.

205
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:39,856
She's so great.

206
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,611
Meredith bad-breath.
Meredith has bad breath.

207
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,274
- Hey
- Hey

208
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,606
- You wanted to see me ?
- Yeah. What do you know about Meredith ?

209
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,984
I don't think she'd be missed.

210
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,241
There's not going to be
downsizing Dwight, ok ?

211
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:57,894
I just, I need to know
a little bit more about...

212
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,248
My friend.

213
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,676
Name : Meredith Palmer.

214
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:04,367
Personal information :
divorced twice, two kids.

215
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,932
Employer : Dundler Mifflin
Paper Incorporated.

216
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,692
- Awards : multiple "Dundies".
- I know that, I know,

217
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:12,472
I just, I need something
kind of embarrassing, you know.

218
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:15,496
- Kind of fun, inside.
- She had a hysterectomy.

219
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:19,529
- Which one is that again ?
- That's when they remove the uterus.

220
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,130
Ho, God ! Dwight no !

221
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,733
I'm trying to write
something funny here ok ?

222
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:26,512
What am I gonna do with
a removed uterus ?

223
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:29,984
- It can be kind of funny.
- You know what, I'm on a deadline here,

224
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:32,642
And just, ok, thanks,
thanks for your help,

225
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:35,440
I'll work it out, thank you Dwight.

226
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:39,482
That wasn't a waste of time.

227
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:42,269
Ok, here's the deal, all right.

228
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:44,758
Pam says that one of
the alliances is meeting...

229
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,430
- In the warehouse during Meredith birthday.
- Oh, my god we have to be there.

230
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:48,945
I know ! But it's going
to be a little tough

231
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:51,442
- Because there's no good place to hide.
- No no ! Yes there is.

232
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,777
- Behind the shells. Oh my god.
- What ? What ? What ?

233
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:56,825
- I know. I know exactly what to do.
- Great.

234
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,439
<i>I'm a deer hunter.
I go all the time with my dad.</i>

235
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:03,192
One thing about deer.
They have very good vision.

236
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:05,893
One thing about me...

237
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:09,828
I'm better at hiding
than they are at vision.

238
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:14,208
It's gonna be perfect, ok ?
Centrally located,

239
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:16,465
Perfect cover, I can hear
and see everything.

240
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,298
Good.

241
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,610
- Michael ?
- Just a sec.

242
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:20,536
- Are you done yet ?
- Almost there.

243
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:22,629
Ok. Just a second.
It is perfect.

244
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,465
Thank you, excellent, here we go.

245
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:29,005
It is time, thank you, ok come one !
Let's go ! Get the cake, let's go.

246
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,117
Here we go !
Come on come on come on !

247
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,047
Be quiet.

248
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,164
Wait this isn't gonna work.
The lid is open.

249
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,344
- So tape it down.
- I can't do that,

250
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:41,019
- then you won't be able to breathe.
- I can breathe just fine, ok ?

251
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:43,486
But if it makes you feel better,
I'll poke holes in the box.

252
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:46,141
- Thank you. Thank you,
- Ok.

253
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,100
Surprise !

254
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:53,878
- Surprise !
- No, it's...

255
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,829
It's surprise Meredith !
One, Two.

256
00:12:57,119 --> 00:13:00,630
Happy birthday to you

257
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:02,772
- Find the key.
- Happy birthday.

258
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:06,659
So you want me to stay here,
and stand next to the box.

259
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,649
No, you need to go
upstairs to the party.

260
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:13,209
- So people don't notice we're both gone.
- Right. That's good.

261
00:13:13,402 --> 00:13:15,620
Can I trust Jim ? I don't know.

262
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,456
<i>Do I have a choice ? No.</i>

263
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:21,031
<i>Frankly I don't. Will I trust Jim ?
Yes.</i>

264
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,100
<i>Should I trust Jim ?</i>

265
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:25,749
You tell me.

266
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,768
<i>Happy birthday to you, Meredith...</i>

267
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:35,154
<i>Happy birthday to you,
and many more</i>

268
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:43,625
- You were surprised weren't you ?
- Yes.

269
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:46,141
You looked freaked, man,
when we said surprise

270
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:49,729
You were like, "what ?
What the hell is going on here ?

271
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:53,376
- Ice cake. Why don't you have some ?
- I can't.

272
00:13:53,742 --> 00:13:55,978
- Come on, a little bit, a little bit.
- No I can't eat dairy.

273
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,478
Oh right. Oh god too bad it's so good.

274
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,244
That makes me sick.

275
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,658
You know what if I were allergic
to dairy I think I'd kill myself.

276
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:07,218
This is way way too good.

277
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,594
<i>- He's in a box ?
- Pam, he's in a BOX.</i>

278
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:17,269
He's downstairs, in a box,
on the floor near the shells.

279
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:21,367
So you just go down there,
and work your magic.

280
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:29,202
Hey ! Where are you ?
Yeah, we were supposed to meet here !

281
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,968
What ?

282
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:34,854
Oh my Gosh !

283
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:39,552
That ties in perfectly with something
that Michael was telling me earlier !

284
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,260
I just don't know what some of the
people in like accounting are gonna do.

285
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:47,896
It's not specifically that...

286
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:52,854
Hey Jim, good party eh ?

287
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:56,491
Just a little some’ wiped up you know
a little moral boost, no big deal.

288
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:59,202
Speaking of which I meant
to tell you, very impressive,

289
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:01,912
the donation you gave
to Oscar's charity.

290
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:05,088
- Was that twenty-five bucks ?
- Well no, yeah you know.

291
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:08,742
Money isn't everything Jim.
Not the key to happiness.

292
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,172
You know what is ?
Joy.

293
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:15,195
You should remember that, maybe give
more than three dollars next time.

294
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:19,647
Yeah well, three dollars a miles
will end up like fifty bucks.

295
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:24,217
So, god, can't even calculate
what you're gonna have to give.

296
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:33,769
Is Oscar around ?

297
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:36,851
I just thought it was
a kind of a flat, you know,

298
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,822
twenty-five dollars one time donation.

299
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:43,044
Didn't think it was a per-mile
kind of deal, you know so...

300
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:45,986
- Well, that's what a walk-athon is.
- I know.

301
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,674
It says here right on the sheet.

302
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:51,330
Look look at the sheet, it says
"it's however many dollars per-mile".

303
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:54,079
Got it, yes so it does.

304
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:57,262
I just think it's kind of cheap to
undonate money to a charity.

305
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,851
No, no no no.
I wasn't I wasn't, no no,

306
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:02,819
It's it's not about the money.

307
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:06,311
It's just it it...
It's the ethics of the thing,

308
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:08,703
Oscar.

309
00:16:10,342 --> 00:16:12,850
How's your nephew ?
Is he in a good shape ?

310
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:14,953
- Yeah.
- How many miles did he do last year ?

311
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:17,702
- Last year he walked eighteen miles.
- Son of a bitch !

312
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:20,557
That is impressive, good for him.

313
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,354
- Happy birthday Meredith.
- Read it out loud !

314
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:47,489
Say who wrote everything.
So we know whose is the best.

315
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,911
Happy bird-day.

316
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,875
"Meredith, good news !
You're not actually a year older,

317
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:00,087
Because you work here,
where time stand still."

318
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,448
- Not bad.
- That was Stanley.

319
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:06,985
"Meredith, happy birthday

320
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,168
You're the best, love Pam."

321
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,030
Thanks darer.

322
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:16,988
This is from Michael :

323
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,155
"Meredith. Let's hope that the only
downsizing that happens to you...

324
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,126
Is that someone downsizes your age."

325
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,234
Because of the downsizing. Rumours.

326
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:31,916
And because you're getting old.

327
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:35,304
No, I, I get it.

328
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:38,140
- It's funny.
- You didn't get the joke.

329
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,426
That's cool, that's you
know what actually

330
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:43,002
I have a bunch of these,

331
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:45,915
good ones that I didn't use.

332
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,750
What was that ?
Oh ok ! Here's a good one.

333
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:53,763
"Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants
her age back and her divorces back".

334
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:57,286
Cause Meredith has been
divorced like, twice. Is that right ?

335
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,194
- You're right.
- Is that right ?

336
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:00,823
- Ok.
- You're right. Yes

337
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:02,531
Divorce...

338
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,065
Oh ok, "Meredith is so old..."

339
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,450
- "How old is she ?"
- Right everybody, you can do it ?

340
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:12,351
"Meredith is so old..."

341
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,994
- How old is she ?
- "She's so old...

342
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,521
She went into an antique
store and they kept her".

343
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,029
That wasn't even mine, I got
that off the internet. Website.

344
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,595
Don't get mad at me.

345
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:31,325
- Nice party Michael.
- This isn't my fault.

346
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:36,775
Ladies, not your best effort.
Streamers ?

347
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:39,997
You could have done better
than that don't you think ?

348
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:43,413
- Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
- Oh, boy.

349
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,377
Ok we, all right people
hold on hold on.

350
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:51,144
Just a second ok, I think we're losing
sight of what is really important here.

351
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,509
And that is that we are...

352
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:58,052
A group of people who work together.

353
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,417
I was, I really wasn't
gonna with on this.

354
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:06,830
I've made a very sizable donation
to Oscar's nephews

355
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,013
walk-athon.

356
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,566
Twenty-five dollars.

357
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:14,514
- Per mile.
- Per-mile, yes.

358
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:16,858
When I retire I...

359
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:19,752
I don't want to just disappear
to one island somewhere.

360
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,868
I want to be the guy who
gives everything back.

361
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:26,389
A check for the kids, and for the teen.

362
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,328
<i>I want it to be like :</i>

363
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:33,363
"Who donated that hospital wing
that is saving somebody's life ?

364
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:37,742
Well, I don't know that was anonymous.

365
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:39,546
Guess what ?

366
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,729
That was Michael Scott.

367
00:19:42,836 --> 00:19:45,961
But it was anonymous, how do you know ?

368
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,601
Because I met him."

369
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:53,244
Thank you Michael.

370
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:56,620
Come here.

371
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,852
Don't cash that until Friday ok ?

372
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,234
- Really today ?
- Yeah.

373
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,961
- Happy birthday.
- Nice.

374
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,199
- I could say something...
- No don't do that.

375
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:12,585
Ok, ok, I have something
that totally tops the box.

376
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:14,061
Oh tell me, tell me.

377
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:18,103
I have just convinced Dwight
that he needs to go to Stanford

378
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,942
<i>and spy on our other branch,
no no no, but before he does so,</i>

379
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,614
<i>I told him that he should die
his hair, to go undercover.</i>

380
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:28,627
If we can get him to
drive to Connecticut

381
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:30,939
and put some bright side in his hair.

382
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:31,968
What the hell is this ?

383
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,482
What, are you trying to cop
a feel or something Halpert ?

384
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:36,230
- No, Dude no. Dude no ! Just listen !
- Hey hey, come on !

385
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,212
God, I don't even know
how to explain this.

386
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:43,042
Dwight asked me to be in an alliance,

387
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:45,955
And then...

388
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,174
We've just been messing with him

389
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:50,817
because of the whole alliance thing...

390
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,473
- It's just office pranks.
- It's stupid, it's just office pranks.

391
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:56,701
Dwight, what the hell
is he talking about ?

392
00:20:58,177 --> 00:21:00,589
I have absolutely no idea.

393
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:04,380
Come on.

394
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:11,103
<i>Do I feel bad about betraying Jim ?</i>

395
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:13,380
<i>Not at all.</i>

396
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,476
<i>That's the game. Convince him
we're on an alliance.</i>

397
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:19,444
<i>Gets him information,
throw him to the wolves.</i>

398
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,222
That's politics baby, get
what you can out of someone,

399
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:24,190
Then crush them.

400
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:27,006
I think Jim might have learned
a very valuable lesson.
