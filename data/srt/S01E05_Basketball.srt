1
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:37,541
Hey you're ready ?

2
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:41,827
All right, all right, secret sign.

3
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:45,040
Hey, Ryan ? very good,

4
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:46,889
excellent, excellent.

5
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,088
Michael !

6
00:00:57,065 --> 00:01:01,394
<i>Today at lunchtime we’re going to
be playing the warehouse staff in a</i>

7
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,549
friendly little game of basketball.

8
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:07,512
My idea. The last time I was down there
I noticed they put up a couple of hoops.

9
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:10,760
And I play basketball every week-end,

10
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,618
so I thought "This might be kind of fun".
And so I started messing around,

11
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,305
and, I'm sinking a few,
you know swish swish swish,

12
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:24,576
nothing but net !
And their jaws just drop to the floor.

13
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:26,851
African Americans !

14
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:31,322
You know it's really
just a good friendly game,

15
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:33,593
a reason for everybody to get together.

16
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:36,860
Pam Pam thank you Ma'am.
Messages please there you go.

17
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,423
Michael can I talk to you
for a second please ?

18
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:40,490
Privately, in your office ?

19
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:44,983
- I think I should be on the team.
- No.

20
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:47,301
And that's not me being mean Dwight,

21
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:50,051
- that is based on your past behavior.
- Oh please.

22
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,252
- When I let him come to my pick up game...
- I apologized for that.

23
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:57,610
I vouched for you, I vouched
for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.

24
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:10,521
Here's what I’m going to do.
The hand strikes and gives a flower.

25
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:13,102
You are not going to play basketball,

26
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:16,251
but I need somebody to come in,

27
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:19,543
and take over the holiday
and weekend work calendar.

28
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,362
- I can handle that.
- Good.

29
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,712
- Excellent, it'll be fun,
- Yeah.

30
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:27,543
because corporate wants somebody
to be here on Saturday,

31
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,161
so we're going to have to have a couple
of people coming in on the weekends,

32
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:34,783
and I know nobody's going to want to do it,
everybody’s going to complain and bitch and,

33
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:36,123
I don't want to have to deal with that.

34
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,001
That's why you have an
assistant regional manager.

35
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,921
Yes it is.

36
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:42,390
- Assistant to the regional manager.
- Same thing.

37
00:02:42,418 --> 00:02:45,612
- No it's not. It's lower so.
- It's close.

38
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:53,850
So we need someone to work this Saturday,
and I think that that should be...

39
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:55,980
Jim.

40
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:59,220
God this is so sad, this is
the smallest amount of power

41
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:02,123
I've ever seen go to someone's head.

42
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,853
- Phyllis, can you believe this ?
- Keep me out of it.

43
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:09,203
My fiancé has plans for us this Saturday

44
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:12,381
so I really hope
Dwight doesn't make me work.

45
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,402
Maybe I should sleep with him.

46
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:19,012
I'm kidding. Kidding. Totally kidding.

47
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:24,112
All right, managing by walking around !

48
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:30,662
This is our warehouse,
or as I like to call it, the whorehouse.

49
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:31,773
But don't you call it that,

50
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:34,251
- I've earned the right.
- Fine, don't worry about that.

51
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:38,700
And here we have
"Miter’ Roger’s neighborhood".

52
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,201
Come on over here, hey,

53
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:43,841
- This is Ryan he's temping upstairs.
- What's up ?

54
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:47,071
- And this is the foreman, "Miter’ Rogers".
- It's not my real name.

55
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,780
No, it's Darryl,
Darryl is "Miter’ Rogers".

56
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:53,003
- Darryl Rogers.
- Darryl Filben,

57
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:58,642
then Bridges, then Rige,
then Roger, then Miter’ Rogers.

58
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:03,321
That is Lonny and this is Roy,
Roy dates Pam,

59
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:05,733
- you know the best looking one upstairs.
- Yeah yeah.

60
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:08,141
You're still getting it regular man ?

61
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:10,942
I mean I can tell her
it's part of the job.

62
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,352
Repel her.

63
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,791
No no I know that
the warrantee is expired,

64
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:21,242
but isn't it supposed to last longer
than two years, if it isn't effective ?

65
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,670
Ok fine three years.

66
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:26,662
Pam gets a little down.
Her toaster having broke,

67
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:30,333
which she got at her engagement shower,

68
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:36,392
for a wedding that
still has yet to be set.

69
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,353
And that was three years ago.

70
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,501
So, one o clock sharp,
and we've got a game on.

71
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:44,553
Well none at one !

72
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:47,730
Oh I see, you're chickening out,
you're bailing on me.

73
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:51,502
No we got a truck going out
at one fifteen so, that's a busy time.

74
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:55,743
Well, I'm glad that sometime is a busy
time because whenever I'm down here,

75
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:58,600
It doesn't seem too busy to me.

76
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:08,103
You can dish it out
but you can't take it.

77
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:10,662
Ok, fine, have it your way.

78
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,991
All right fine, you know what ?

79
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:24,153
- One o clock.
- All right, see you at one.

80
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:32,011
Are we ready for the game ?

81
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:35,430
I know, grumble grumble,

82
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:38,713
but you would follow me to the ends
of the earth grumbling all the way.

83
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:42,290
Like that dwarf,
from "Lord of the Rings".

84
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:44,171
- Gimli.
- Nerd.

85
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:47,373
- That is why you're not on the team.
- Just trying to be helpful.

86
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:50,843
Oh ul, I'll ul. Dragon Slayer.
Ten point power sword.

87
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:52,381
That's him.

88
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:55,800
Ok, so let's put together
the starting lineup shall we ?

89
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:59,032
- Stanley, of course.
- I'm sorry ?

90
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,901
- What do you play, center ?
- Why of course ?

91
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,010
What's that supposed to mean ?

92
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,432
I don't know,
I don't remember saying that.

93
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,291
- I heard it.
- People hear a lot of things, man.

94
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:16,943
Other starters... me of course.
I heard it that time.

95
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:21,711
I'd like to play, if it's just for fun.
I played basketball in school.

96
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:24,461
Uh, yeah, who else ?

97
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:29,270
We have Jim, we have Ryan,
the new guy, right untested,

98
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:32,840
willing to prove himself right now,
lot of passion, lot of heart...

99
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:35,863
But I'm getting paid
to skip lunch right ?

100
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:35,812
Yes.

101
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:42,551
Yes,  this is business. The business
of team building and moral boosting.

102
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:46,553
- Uh, who else ?
- I can help out if you need me.

103
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:50,941
I will use your talents come baseball
season my friend, or if we box.

104
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,712
-  I have a hoop in my drive way.
- No.

105
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:56,420
I have sport's bra.
No, no ! Ridiculous.

106
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,153
Michael look !

107
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:09,181
Close  all right. Me, Stan the man,
Jim, Ryan and Dwight. Sorry fellows.

108
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:11,132
- Can I be team captain ?
- No I'm team captain.

109
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,013
- Can I be team manager ?
- No I am the team manager,

110
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,663
- you can be assistant to the team manager.
- Assistant team manager ?

111
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:15,662
No.

112
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:18,390
Ok we'll see who is working
this weekend then.

113
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:20,523
Jim, you're in charge of
the vacation's schedule now.

114
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:22,090
Oh my god...

115
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:24,691
Threat neutralized.

116
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,353
Off the backboard !

117
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:48,551
- Please don't throw a garbage at me.
- Oh Pam with this anger.

118
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:53,400
Hey Pam, how would you like
to be our cheerleader today ?

119
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:55,733
You know, some pink tails,

120
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,510
little halter top you can tie that up,

121
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:02,743
and you know something a little...
just useful for a change, just this once.

122
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:04,310
I don't think so Michael.

123
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:06,750
Besides I can't cheer against my fiancé.

124
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:07,762
I'll do it.

125
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:10,660
Wear a little fancy skirt if you want.

126
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:14,701
Yeah I bet you would, just
try not to be too gay on the court.

127
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:19,371
And by gay I mean, you know,
not in a homosexual way at all,

128
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:22,023
I mean, you know,
like the bad at sports way.

129
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,840
I think that goes without saying.

130
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:26,262
- Maybe Angela would cheerlead ?
- Yeah right.

131
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:29,812
- I'll do it.
- That's worse than you playing.

132
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:36,090
Cause you know what ? We need you as
an alternate in case somebody gets hurt.

133
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:38,293
That's where we need you.

134
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:41,180
Bless would be those who sit and wait.

135
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:46,561
You made it !
Suit up you're on the team !

136
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,522
All right. Cool ! Very good.

137
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:57,493
A spy from the warehouse, trying
to figure out our players eh man ?

138
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,760
Just getting a tea-bag.

139
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:03,731
He's running, but he can't hide,
because you know what ?

140
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:05,970
one o clock
you'd better bring your A game,

141
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:10,222
because me and my posse guys,
we're going to be in your face.

142
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:11,503
Right in your face.

143
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,808
Why don't we make it more interesting ?
Loser buys dinner at Farley's.

144
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,405
I like the way you think. You know
what I'll take that one step further :

145
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:23,956
Loser works on Saturday.

146
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:28,092
No, that's not of much fun.

147
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,441
- You know what ?
- Oh what ?

148
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:35,360
- You're on.
- Ok.

149
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,750
Cool. You're on.

150
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:43,020
Don't screw this up !

151
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:54,190
Classic beginners mistaken,
eating before game.

152
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:12,613
Has anyone seen the first aid kit ?

153
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:18,753
How many times have I told you ?
I'm the safety officer, not you.

154
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:39,690
Basketball, was kind of my thing,
in high school,

155
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:42,623
and yeah, I'm looking forward to play.

156
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:45,373
You know I think I'm going
to impress a few people in here.

157
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:49,022
- You're coming down ?
- Yeah I'm just forwarding the phones.

158
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,432
- Will you wish me luck ?
- Yeah you're going to need it.

159
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:55,081
Wow ! Is that trash talk from Pam ?

160
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,511
I'm just saying Roy is very competitive,

161
00:10:57,518 --> 00:11:01,392
and he wants to take the wave runners
to the lake this Saturday, so...

162
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:05,301
Well I'm going to
the outlet mall on Saturday, so

163
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:10,011
if you want to save big on brand names,
and Roy has to work, which he will,

164
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:14,680
because I'm also competitive,
you should feel free to come along.

165
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,183
I think I'm going to be up at the lake.

166
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:23,761
I think I'll see you at the mall...
yeah.

167
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,343
There he is. Secret weapon !

168
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:42,701
All right guys, come on !
Let's bring it in. Here we go.

169
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:49,243
OK. Listen, this is just going to be
a friendly game, right ?

170
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:53,903
We're all on the same team here,
the Dundler Mifflin team.

171
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,332
Of course if you beat us, you're fired.

172
00:11:57,838 --> 00:11:59,443
That's a joke !

173
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:04,340
Ok. Let's do it !

174
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:07,962
- Have a good game man !
- Yeah, you too, should be fun.

175
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:11,810
All right everybody stretch out a little
bit. Stretch, stretch it, full stretch.

176
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:14,993
- Ryan you want to stretch ?
- I stretched before I came.

177
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:20,011
Ok Ryan you have Darryl. I have Roy.

178
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:21,861
Really ? I thought I'd take Roy.

179
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,980
No actually, I think Roy
is their best player, not lying.

180
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,650
So Dwight you have the east German girl.

181
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:41,451
- Ok we'll be skins !
- No.

182
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,840
Come on Dwight.

183
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:46,082
- What ? Shirts on or off ?
- On ! Put it on !

184
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,182
- You're sure ?
- Yes.

185
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:49,833
Pam, you kind of have
your foots on both camps here,

186
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,812
why don't you do the jump ball ?

187
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,622
Don't listen to him Pam, trust me.

188
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:56,683
Tip it my way or
you'll sleep in the car !

189
00:12:58,658 --> 00:12:59,900
Stanley !

190
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:05,371
What ? You got to be kidding me !

191
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:12,020
Here we go, who's at him who's at him ?
Somebody get him !

192
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:21,123
Over here ! Three !

193
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:23,381
Let's go to zone,
let's go on a zone !

194
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:24,553
Defense !

195
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:25,591
Defense !

196
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:26,841
Defense !

197
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:28,382
Defense !

198
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,563
Who's got Roy ?

199
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:49,411
Oh come on, what is wrong
with me today ? Usually hit those.

200
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:59,631
Dwight I was open.
All right, let's go.

201
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:08,421
Aw ! Ok, foul, charging,

202
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:12,770
That's foul. Ok I'll take it.

203
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:37,180
When I'm playing hoops,

204
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:41,061
all of the stress and responsibility
of my job here just melts away.

205
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:44,232
It's gone, in the zone.

206
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,221
Three ! What's with me today ?-

207
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,410
Who am I ? Am I Michael Scott ?

208
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:51,571
I don't know.
I might just be a basketball machine.

209
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:54,231
What's Dundler Mifflin ?
I've never heard of it.

210
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:58,423
Filing, paper works, who cares ?
Possible downsizing ?

211
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:02,742
That's probably going to happen actually.

212
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:08,133
Jim right here, give me the ball,
Ryan cut !

213
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:09,833
My bad.

214
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:17,620
Where you're at.

215
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:19,400
Where you're at.

216
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:25,491
Is that like the robot ?

217
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:28,533
Nice !

218
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:33,373
Just do one, that's cool, that's fine.

219
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:35,633
All right let's go.

220
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,332
Back off !

221
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:41,772
Come on ! Hey Dwight !

222
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:48,391
Yeah, in your face !

223
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:49,542
Dwight !

224
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:52,800
Football, is like rock'n'roll,
it's just...

225
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:57,032
And basketball is like Jazz,
you know you kind of...

226
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:02,582
downbeat, it's in the pocket,
it's like you...

227
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,241
Time out !

228
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:28,562
Come on, sellers, over here.
Bring it in ! Come on !

229
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:32,163
What's going on ? You guys
are playing like a bunch of girls.

230
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:34,320
- You know what ? Let me take Roy.
- All right we'll switch,

231
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:36,342
Take it up a notch. Come on !

232
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:58,171
Foul ! Naked aggression !

233
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:02,152
Oh  that is, you're all right Jim ?
Suck it up.

234
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:11,641
Ouch ! How much does it hurt ?

235
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:25,932
Yes !

236
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:27,802
What the hell man ?

237
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,950
- Take it easy.
- No you take it easy !

238
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,212
Same team Dwight.

239
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:43,540
Yes !

240
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:48,261
Yeah !

241
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:49,182
Yeah !

242
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:50,413
Yeah !

243
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:53,101
In your face !

244
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:56,190
- Angela, what's the score ?
- You're ahead.

245
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,623
Yeah baby, here we go !

246
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:02,810
Jim, Jim right here !
Ouch ! Hold it !

247
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:05,592
I'm sorry. Are you all right ?

248
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:04,242
Foul !

249
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:05,583
God !

250
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:07,230
- That hurts,
- I'm sorry.

251
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:09,991
- What's your problem man ?
- I didn't mean to do this.

252
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:12,050
Just clack at me for no reason ?

253
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:14,910
- Take you shot man !
- NO no no !

254
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:17,060
That was a flagrant
personal intentional foul.

255
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,740
- No way it wasn't.
- Yes it was.

256
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:22,982
- I'm just being fair.
- Oh really, I just moved my arm.

257
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:26,480
Game over ! That is it.
I'm sorry you know.

258
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,691
I hate to do it this way,
but you know that's just,

259
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:32,372
we're having a friendly game,
it's a shame !

260
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:33,972
This is a damn shame !

261
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:37,091
We're like a family here,
and that's just, that won't fly.

262
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,532
- This is a cold pack.
- Give me that.

263
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,162
You have to break into your bag.

264
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,340
Thanks Dwight.

265
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:46,770
What does that mean ?
What is it, a tie ? What's going on ?

266
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,252
- Let's just say, whoever was ahead won.
- That was you...

267
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,483
It was us really ? I didn't know.

268
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:59,083
Great. Now you see
who was work on Saturday, your face.

269
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:02,890
- No, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
- Yeah this isn't happening.

270
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:10,171
Guys, you know, I'm the boss so...

271
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:15,142
Yeah, so what's that,
we're coming on Monday right ?

272
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,292
Monday ?

273
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:27,090
You guys believed me ? Come on...

274
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:31,791
dogs you know,
you should know me better than that.

275
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:37,562
No, do you think that
would have been good for moral ? No.

276
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:42,202
Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed with
even that close so. Now of course,

277
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,561
We're coming in Saturday.

278
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:49,491
Good game. Word.

279
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:26,051
So I talked to this accountant, it
looks good. I haven't signed anything.

280
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:27,541
- Hey baby !
- Hey !

281
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:31,112
Larry bird, Larry legend.

282
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:34,371
Yeah he's pretty good uh ?

283
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:41,971
- Let's get you into a tub.
- Yeah ? And you in a tub.

284
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:49,751
Hey. What a game, what a game !

285
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:51,913
What time do we have to come in ?

286
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:58,262
Come on, lets not be gloomy here man,
we're on this together, we're a team.

287
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,461
You know what ?

288
00:21:04,706 --> 00:21:05,861
Screw corporate !

289
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:09,392
Nobody's coming in tomorrow,
you have the day off.

290
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:13,230
Like how even an extra day is going
to prevent us from being downsized ?

291
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,433
Have a good weekend.

292
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:21,752
The great thing about sports is
that it is all about character.

293
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:28,183
And you can learn lessons about life
even if you don't win.

294
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:31,270
But  we did, because we were ahead.
