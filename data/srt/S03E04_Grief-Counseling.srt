1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,102
Hey, Ryan.

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:05,104
Can I get you a pencil
from the warehouse?

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,939
Uh, no thanks.
I'm good.

4
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:08,974
Oh, it's okay.
I'm going down.

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,342
Um...

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,577
Oh.

7
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:12,878
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,946
Absolutely.

9
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:15,514
All right, I'll be right back.

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,558
- Whoo!
- There you go.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,559
Awesome!

12
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,694
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

13
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,062
Michael, could you get me a pen

14
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,130
from down in the warehouse?

15
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,765
Don't mind if I do.

16
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,534
See you in a minute.

17
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,869
Okay!

18
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,679
Whoo!

19
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,881
There you go,
fresh from the warehouse.

20
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,115
Hey, Michael.

21
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,284
Would you get me some coffee
from the warehouse?

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,919
There's coffee
in the kitchen, Pam.

23
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,455
But the warehouse coffee
tastes so much better.

24
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,456
Yeah, it's better.

25
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,725
All right.
All right.

26
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,693
Okay.

27
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,040
I am like Bette Midler
in For the Boys.

28
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,842
Gotta keep the troops
entertained.

29
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,819
With cream and sugar?

30
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,855
All right.

31
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,256
So I wanted to let you know

32
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,191
that we lost Ed Truck.

33
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,693
Oh... kay.

34
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,428
Let me see if I have his cell.

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,797
Is this the only reason
you are calling, Jan?

36
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,265
Or does somebody miss me?

37
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:17,903
Michael... Ed died
over the weekend.

38
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,071
Oh, wow.

39
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,506
Attention, everybody.

40
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,641
I just received a call
from corporate

41
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,511
with some news that they felt
that I should know first.

42
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:26,945
My old boss,

43
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,214
Ed Truck, has died.

44
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,951
Oh, Michael,
that's such terrible news.

45
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,554
You must feel so sad.

46
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,723
Yes, I am.

47
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,825
It's very sad.

48
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,594
Because he was my boss.

49
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,796
Oh, that's a shame.
Ed was a good guy.

50
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,765
That's right.
You worked with him.

51
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,368
So did Creed.

52
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,369
Well, I'll be in my office.

53
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,971
In case anybody
wants to drop by.

54
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,907
Cheer me up.

55
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,752
So did you hear the news?

56
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,520
The news that you
just announced?

57
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,588
That Ed died?

58
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,956
Yeah.

59
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,224
Is there anything I can do?

60
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,660
Oh, gosh, what can
anybody do, really?

61
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:15,994
Just... psh.

62
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,630
He was almost 70.
Circle of life.

63
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,666
Yeah.

64
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,139
Oh. Okay.

65
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,876
Yeah.

66
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,246
Mmmmm.

67
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,448
Okay.

68
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,450
What's going on with
Fairfield County Schools?

69
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,252
Karen, did you generate
that price list?

70
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:43,522
Um... shoot.
Uh, I will. Sorry.

71
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,924
Okay, just get it done.

72
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:46,959
Jim, will you make sure?

73
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,194
Oh, yeah, definitely.

74
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,663
Suck up!

75
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,731
Ahem!

76
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,032
Josh, did you hear what I said?

77
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,867
Thank you, everyone.

78
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,307
Damn it.

79
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,476
What's up?

80
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,411
Oh, nothing.

81
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,247
They're just out
of Herr's Chips.

82
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,248
Oh.

83
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,249
But don't worry about it.

84
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,750
My snack food doesn't fall

85
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,685
under the umbrella
of your authority.

86
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,722
Mm, that's where you're wrong.

87
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,825
I'm your project
supervisor today.

88
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,260
And I've just decided

89
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,694
that we're not doing anything

90
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,464
until you get the chips
that you require.

91
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,133
So I think we should
go get some.

92
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,968
Now, please.

93
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,071
It's a real shame about Ed, huh?

94
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,641
Yeah. Must really
have you thinkin'.

95
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,042
About what?

96
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,210
The older you get,

97
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,078
the bigger the chance is
you're gonna die.

98
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,213
You knew that.

99
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:42,648
Ed was decapitated.

100
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,783
What?
Really?

101
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,084
He was drunk as a skunk.

102
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,786
He was flying down Route 6.

103
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,821
He slides under
an 18-wheeler.

104
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,223
Pop, it snaps right off.

105
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,158
Oh, my God.

106
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,027
That is the way to go.

107
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,163
Instant death.
Very smart.

108
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,898
You know, a human can go on
living for several hours

109
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,566
after being decapitated.

110
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,535
You're thinking of a chicken.

111
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,103
What'd I say?

112
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,105
That is just not the way

113
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,707
a Dunder Mifflin manager
should go.

114
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,875
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,311
Alone, out of the blue.

116
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,713
Not even have his own head
to comfort him.

117
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,449
So I'm not exactly...

118
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,017
sure how to say this.

119
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,986
- Ed was decapitated.
- What are you doing?

120
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,821
You said you didn't
know how to say it.

121
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,589
He...

122
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,058
was driving

123
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,693
on the road.

124
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,695
And he went under a truck.

125
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,363
And that's when his

126
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,632
h-h-head was...

127
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,535
separated from...

128
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,903
the rest of him.

129
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,571
And I will let you know more

130
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,007
as soon as I find out.

131
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,945
Hey.
Hi.

132
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,680
If my head ever comes off,

133
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,415
I would like you
to put it on ice.

134
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,651
I do not want
to talk about this.

135
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,053
When I die,

136
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,588
I want to be frozen.

137
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,623
And if they have to freeze me
in pieces,

138
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,192
so be it.

139
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,361
I will wake up
stronger than ever,

140
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,962
because I will have
used that time

141
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,698
to figure out exactly
why I died,

142
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,899
and what moves I could have used

143
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,067
to defend myself better

144
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,370
now that I know what hold
he had me in.

145
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,805
I don't understand.

146
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,141
We have a day honoring
Martin Luther King.

147
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,777
But he didn't even work here.

148
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,445
I understand
how you feel, Michael.

149
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,847
I really do.

150
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,117
So would it be helpful
to give everyone the day off?

151
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,852
You really don't get it, do you?

152
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,053
You don't understand
these people.

153
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,055
That is the last thing
that they would want

154
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,189
is a day off.

155
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,692
Well, what would you suggest?

156
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,327
A statue.

157
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,828
- Of Ed?
- Yeah.

158
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,464
I'm not sure that's realistic.

159
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,466
Well, I think it would
be very realistic.

160
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,934
It would look just like him.

161
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:43,969
No, that's not...

162
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,303
We could have his eyes light up.

163
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,638
You could have his arms move.

164
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,740
That is not a statue.
That is a robot.

165
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,475
I think that is
a great way to honor Ed.

166
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,210
And how big
do you want this robot?

167
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,211
Life-size.

168
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,647
Mm, no.
Better make it 2/3.

169
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,149
Easier to stop
if it turns on us.

170
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,518
What the hell
are you two talking about?

171
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,421
Well, we are talking
about how to properly honor

172
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,022
a man who gave his life

173
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,725
as regional manger
of this company, Jan!

174
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:07,993
You know what, Michael?

175
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,127
I've really
tried with you today.

176
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,695
And I have to get back to work.

177
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,863
Oh, do you?

178
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,465
You know who wished
they could get back to work

179
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,599
is Ed Truck!

180
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,568
But Ed Truck can't
because he is...

181
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,736
- Good-bye.
- dead!

182
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,241
Look... I gave him
a six-foot extension cord,

183
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,743
so he can't chase us.

184
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,244
That's perfect.

185
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,881
Okay, that is a no
on the West Side Market.

186
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,983
Okay, great.
I think that's enough.

187
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,085
Can I... get back
to work now?

188
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,456
Wow. Never pegged you
for a quitter.

189
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,990
I am not a quitter.

190
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,725
I will do this
all day, if you want.

191
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,160
- Really?
- Yeah, all day.

192
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,795
Hey.
What are we doing?

193
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,130
What's the game?
I want in.

194
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,431
Oh, there's no game.

195
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,966
We're just trying to get
these chips for Karen.

196
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,268
Did you check
the vending machine?

197
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,538
Oh, the vending machines?
How did we miss that?

198
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,207
I have no idea.

199
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,575
We went right for the copier.

200
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,276
Mm-hmm. And then we
checked the fax machine.

201
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,344
Yeah, nothing there.

202
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,280
Did you check your butt?

203
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,651
Ooh, can you imagine
how much blood there was?

204
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,653
If it happened right here,

205
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,655
it would reach
all the way to reception.

206
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,790
Probably get on Pam.

207
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,892
- Okay, that's enough.
- What?

208
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,160
We do not want
to hear about this.

209
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,495
Well, you know what?

210
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,863
I didn't wanna
hear about it either, Stanley.

211
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,598
But I did, and now I can't
stop picturing it.

212
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,566
He leaves work.
He's on his way home.

213
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,903
Wham! His cappa is detated
from his head.

214
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,472
You have just spit on my face.

215
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,507
Well, you know what?

216
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,674
There's something wrong
with you.

217
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,576
There is something wrong
with everybody in here.

218
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,745
Because we have lost

219
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,580
a member of our family.

220
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,048
And you don't wanna
talk about it.

221
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,183
You don't wanna think about it.

222
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,418
You just wanna get back to work.

223
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,754
There are five stages to grief.

224
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,623
Which are denial,

225
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,159
anger, bargaining,
depression, and acceptance.

226
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,762
And right now, out there,

227
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,597
they are all denying

228
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,399
the fact that they're sad.

229
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,768
And... that's hard.

230
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,204
And it's making them all angry.

231
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,440
And it is my job
to try to get them

232
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,010
all the way through
to acceptance.

233
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,912
And if not acceptance,
then just depression.

234
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,382
If I can get them depressed,
then I'll have done my job.

235
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,751
I'm going to throw you
this ball.

236
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,953
When you catch the ball,
I want you to say

237
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,923
the name of a person
very important to you,

238
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,458
somebody really special,
who died.

239
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,061
And then I want you to say
how they died.

240
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,729
And you may cry, if you like.

241
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,131
That is encouraged.

242
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,966
Let me just start.
Let me show you how this works.

243
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,135
I catch the ball.

244
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,070
I lost Ed Truck.

245
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,440
And... it feels like somebody
took my heart

246
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:40,145
and dropped it into a bucket
of boiling tears.

247
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,781
And, at the same time,

248
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,718
somebody else is hitting my soul

249
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,420
in the crotch

250
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:51,423
with a frozen sledgehammer.

251
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,358
And then a third guy walks in

252
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,160
and starts punching me
in the grief bone.

253
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,562
And I am crying.

254
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,064
And nobody can hear me,

255
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:03,134
because I am terribly,
terribly...

256
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,769
terribly alone.

257
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,838
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

258
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,139
I need to see Pam.

259
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,141
There seems to be, like,
something wrong

260
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,610
with the radiator in her car.

261
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,611
Okay.

262
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,679
Fine.
Hurry back.

263
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,983
There's nothing wrong
with your car.

264
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,284
I just thought you might
want a break

265
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,886
from the grief
counseling session.

266
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,623
Oh... I would
like a break.

267
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,758
How are you liking the new car?

268
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,461
Great.
Yeah?

269
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,262
It sure is small.

270
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:33,932
Got air bags?

271
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,333
I think so.

272
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,802
I don't know, I was mainly
focused on the cup holders.

273
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:43,141
Well, you're still not
driving so fast, are you?

274
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,676
Yeah.

275
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,016
Hi, yeah, this is Mike
from the West Side Market.

276
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,717
Well, we added a shipment

277
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,853
of Herr's
salt and vinegar chips.

278
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:58,023
And we ordered that about
three weeks ago, and have...

279
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,724
Yeah.

280
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:00,992
You have 'em in the warehouse?

281
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,293
Great.

282
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,330
What is my store number?

283
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,299
Six.

284
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,503
Wa... no.
I'll call you back.

285
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,338
Shut up.
Six?

286
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,976
Okay, we can start.

287
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,411
You waited for me?

288
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,578
Yeah.

289
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,013
Pam, you're a member
of this family.

290
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,081
So we will wait

291
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,816
for our family members.

292
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,184
Phyllis, you wanna
give it a shot?

293
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,053
I got it.

294
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,754
When my mother
was pregnant with me,

295
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,624
they did an ultrasound
and found she was having twins.

296
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,626
When they did another ultrasound

297
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,627
a few weeks later,

298
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,729
they discovered that

299
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:42,133
I had re-sorbed
the other fetus.

300
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,436
Do I regret this?
No.

301
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,871
I believe his tissue
has made me stronger.

302
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,074
I now have the strength
of a grown man

303
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,176
and a little baby.

304
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,678
Okay, why don't you
throw the ball to somebody else?

305
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,813
Nope.

306
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,915
Oh, yes, Stanley,
Come on, your turn.

307
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,349
- You have to go.
- I will not!

308
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,418
Okay...

309
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,686
I'm going to

310
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,021
toss the ball

311
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,123
to Pam.

312
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,491
Let's see.

313
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,159
I had an aunt

314
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,661
that I was really close to.

315
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,731
She was this amazing
female boxer.

316
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,934
Um, anyway,
she was injured in a fight,

317
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,836
and she was paralyzed.

318
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:22,140
So you can imagine
how upset I was...

319
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,408
when I found out

320
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,310
that she asked her manager

321
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,345
to remove her breathing tube

322
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,515
so she could die.

323
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,084
Wow.

324
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,520
If you want to cry, that's okay.

325
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,693
Thanks.
Um...

326
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,261
A few years ago,

327
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,830
my family was
on a safari in Africa.

328
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,634
And, um, my cousin...
Mufasa...

329
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,438
was, um, he was
trampled to death

330
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,306
by a pack of wildebeests.

331
00:12:55,308 --> 00:13:00,512
And, um, we all...
took it really hard.

332
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,681
All of us kind
of in the audience...

333
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,049
of what happened.

334
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,218
Do you wanna
talk about it anymore?

335
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,454
Oh, it would probably
take me, like,

336
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,689
an hour and a half
to tell that whole story.

337
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:12,757
Me me, me me me.

338
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,726
Yes. Okay.

339
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:18,730
Um... I was trying
to throw this party once.

340
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:22,400
And everyone was over
for the weekend.

341
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:26,204
And then my Uncle Bernie died.

342
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:29,073
And so me and

343
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,308
my best friend,

344
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,178
we had to pretend
like he was alive.

345
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,846
So...

346
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,614
Wait a second.

347
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,350
That's Weekend at Bernie's.

348
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Do you think that this
is a game?

349
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,088
Well, there is a ball.

350
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,123
All right, we're starting over.

351
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,424
No, I'm done.

352
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,359
You are not leaving!
No, we are not done.

353
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,928
We really have
a lot of work to do.

354
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,995
Yeah, well, you know what?

355
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,265
The guy who had my job has died.

356
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,434
And nobody cares.

357
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,570
And he sat at my desk.

358
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,171
Michael...

359
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,941
Look, I know
this is hard for you.

360
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,843
But death's just a part of life.

361
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,544
I mean, just this morning,
I saw a little bird

362
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,681
fly into the glass doors
downstairs and die.

363
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,583
And I had to keep going.

364
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,051
How do you know?
What?

365
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,886
That that bird was dead?

366
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,888
Did you check...
its breathing?

367
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,956
It was obvious.

368
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,691
Was its heart beating, Toby?

369
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,926
Did you check it?
No, of course you didn't.

370
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,261
You're not a veterinarian.

371
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,163
You don't know anything!

372
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,564
Michael!

373
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:30,435
Michael!

374
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,937
Michael!

375
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,038
Michael...

376
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,106
Oh, God.

377
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,641
Ohh!
Oh, my God!

378
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,776
Oh, my God!
Come on.

379
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:39,811
Poor little fella.

380
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,179
- Oh, shoot.
- He's a goner.

381
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,814
- No, he's not.
- Yeah.

382
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:43,882
No, he's not.

383
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,283
Michael, get him
away from your head!

384
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,551
He is covered
in germs and bacteria!

385
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,120
You can't get
diseases from a bird!

386
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,723
A dead bird should not
be in the kitchen.

387
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,757
We don't know if it's dead.

388
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,526
Uh, no, that thing is dead.

389
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,828
You want me to flush him?

390
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,698
Attention, everybody.

391
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,567
This will only take a second...

392
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,069
of your time.

393
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,671
Today at 4:00 p.m.,

394
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,207
we will be meeting
in the parking lot

395
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,611
to have a funeral service
for this bird.

396
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,779
I have a lot of work to do.

397
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,582
Well... I'm sorry
to inconvenience you,

398
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,883
Meredith.

399
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,619
But that is what you do
when things die.

400
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,954
You honor them.

401
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,689
Toby killed this bird.

402
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,291
And now we are going
to honor it.

403
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,759
- But...
- No! No! No!

404
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:28,893
That's enough.
You know what?

405
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,329
This bird is dead.

406
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,397
It died alone.

407
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,898
The least you can do

408
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,201
is be there for him now.

409
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,039
Find a box for him.

410
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,608
I'm calling a supermarket
in Montreal.

411
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,842
Nice.

412
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,878
Bonjour, je cherche

413
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,080
de chips de la marque Herr's.

414
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,682
Non?

415
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,584
Oh, merci comme même.

416
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,953
Au revoir.

417
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,020
Nope.

418
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,956
- Sounded good.
- Thanks.

419
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,433
It's okay.

420
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,834
It's okay.

421
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,736
Shh.
Yes, I know.

422
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,571
I know it's been a tough day.

423
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,506
But it's good to let it show.

424
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,810
I mean, how many times
do I have to confirm plans

425
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,713
with Ryan for him to know
that we have a date tonight?

426
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,086
God.

427
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,587
What are...

428
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,888
What are you doing?!

429
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,223
What?

430
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,524
No, this is
about the right size.

431
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,893
No, God, no!
It's not!

432
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,462
What is the matter with you?

433
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,963
Is that the beak?

434
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,967
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.

435
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,803
We slaughtered a pig
whenever we wanted bacon.

436
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,940
My grandfather was re-buried
in an old oil drum.

437
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,945
It would've fit if he had
given me another minute.

438
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,813
I need a box.

439
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,216
I need a box, a small box.

440
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,518
Not too confining.

441
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,853
- Is it for the bird?
- Yeah.

442
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,987
I have it covered.

443
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,189
Oh, thank you.

444
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,326
If you want to do something
for the funeral...

445
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,727
Yes, please.

446
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,329
Maybe you could play a song
on your recorder. Excellent.

447
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,231
Do you have it with you?
Always.

448
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,002
Did I wake up this morning
thinking I'd be

449
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,737
throwing together
a bird funeral?

450
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,673
You never can tell
what your day here

451
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,242
is gonna turn into.

452
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,481
Where'd you find them?

453
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,316
Where'd I find what?

454
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,993
I called the manufacturer,

455
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,028
who referred me
to the distributor,

456
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,130
who referred me
to the vending machine company,

457
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,599
who told me that
they sell them in the machines

458
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,334
in the building next door.

459
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,270
Glad you could all make it.

460
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,771
You told us we had to.

461
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,540
Dwight, do you have the box?

462
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,275
Actually, I have it.

463
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,213
You made this?

464
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,881
Wow.

465
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:07,218
That's...
that's very nice.

466
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,220
When I was five, my mom told me

467
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,155
that my fish
went to the hospital

468
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,623
in the toilet.

469
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,525
And it never came back.

470
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,427
So we had a funeral for it.

471
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,795
And I remember thinking,

472
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,831
"I'm a little too old
for this."

473
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,867
And I was five.

474
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,202
I'd also like
to say a few words,

475
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,470
if that's okay.

476
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,372
Yes.

477
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,409
What do we know about this bird?

478
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,779
You might think,
"Not much, it's just a bird."

479
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,881
But we do know some things.

480
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,951
We know it was a local bird.

481
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,521
Maybe it's that same bird
that surprised Oscar

482
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,390
that one morning with
a special present from above.

483
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,526
Oh, I remember that.
That was so funny.

484
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,294
And we know how he died.

485
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,231
Flying into the glass doors.

486
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,465
But you know what,

487
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,501
I don't think
he was being stupid.

488
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,970
I think he just...

489
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,839
really, really wanted
to come inside our building

490
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,509
to spread his cheer

491
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,844
and lift our spirits
with a song.

492
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,579
- It's not a songbird.
- Shh.

493
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,148
An impression, then.

494
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,184
Lastly, we can't help but notice

495
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,319
that he was by himself
when he died.

496
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,188
But of course, we all know

497
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,790
that doesn't mean he was alone.

498
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,092
Because I'm sure

499
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,793
that there were lots
of other birds

500
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,195
out there who cared for him

501
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,430
very much.

502
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,866
He will not be forgotten.
Amen.

503
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,850
Society teaches us

504
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:50,121
that having feelings and crying

505
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,757
is bad and wrong.

506
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,393
Well, that's baloney,

507
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:59,630
because grief isn't wrong.

508
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,099
There is such a thing
as good grief.

509
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,535
Just ask Charlie Brown.

510
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,377
Let's get back to work.

511
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,960
Guys, get a broom.

512
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,494
Let's clean this up.

513
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,096
Grab a broom.

514
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,165
You heard me.
Mush.
