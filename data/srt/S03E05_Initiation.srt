1
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:05,838
Brain teaser.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,906
I have two coins
totaling 15 cents.

3
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,742
One of them is not a nickel.
What are they?

4
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:10,809
A dime and a nickel.

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,312
No, I said one of them
is not a nickel...

6
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,546
But the other one is.

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:15,748
I've heard that before.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,651
Okay, a man and his son
get into a car accident.

9
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,186
They are rushed to the hospital.

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,454
The doctor says,

11
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,922
"There's no way I can
operate on this boy."

12
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,224
"Because he's my son."

13
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,825
The doctor is the boy's mother.

14
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,361
A man is found hanging
from the ceiling.

15
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,796
He stepped on a block of ice,
hung himself,

16
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,798
and the ice melted.

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,600
A hunter...

18
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:35,601
It's a polar bear because
you're at the North Pole.

19
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:37,002
Damn it!

20
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,570
Tell me what you did yesterday.

21
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,572
Uh, nothing.

22
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,507
- Nothing?
- Yeah, nothing.

23
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,708
How was your day?

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,143
I don't care
how your day was, Michael.

25
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,345
Wow.

26
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,914
Well, okay.

27
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,949
I don't care how
your day was either, Jan.

28
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,951
I was just asking you
because you asked me.

29
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,120
Tell me what you did yesterday.

30
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,521
I worked.

31
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,124
And then I went home
to my condo.

32
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,625
And Carol came over.

33
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,794
And we had sex.

34
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,163
Is that what you want to hear?

35
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,467
Never, ever, ever sleep
with your boss.

36
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,968
I'm so lucky that Jan and I

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,670
only got to second base.

38
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:45,838
Hi, Pam.

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,072
- Hi.
- I'm great.

40
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,308
So, Pam, I'd like you to keep

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,610
a log of everything
Michael does hour by hour

42
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,811
so that we can analyze it
at corporate, okay?

43
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,880
Oh, I don't know...
Thanks, Pam.

44
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,816
It's weird.

45
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,151
Jan used to treat Michael

46
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,752
like he was a 10-year-old.

47
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,921
But lately it's like he's five.

48
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,790
So, are you excited?

49
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,291
Yeah.

50
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,527
Very excited?

51
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,363
Yes, I'm very excited.

52
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,165
Extremely excited?

53
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,102
Just very...
That's cool.

54
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,371
I have spent a year here.

55
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:24,109
And I have to commit
or get out, so...

56
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,944
Dwight's the top salesman
in the company,

57
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,380
and he's taking me on
my first sales call today.

58
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,116
And, um, I'm excited.

59
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:35,354
I am very excited.
Ryan hasn't made a sale yet.

60
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:39,791
But more importantly,
he hasn't made an ally yet.

61
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,194
Is he gonna be a slacker-
loser-wise-ass like Jim was,

62
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:45,831
or is he gonna join
the Dwight Army of Champions?

63
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,566
So, what if
they're not talking much?

64
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,802
Then does it make sense to
kind of lead the conversation?

65
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,638
You know, just until it gets
to a point where

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,440
they are asking questions?

67
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,717
So, where's the sales office?

68
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,653
When you are ready
to see the sales office,

69
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,055
the sales office will
present itself to you.

70
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,793
Your journey begins now.

71
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,967
Hey.

72
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,769
What?

73
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,771
My chair's squeaking.

74
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:26,805
Is it?

75
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,273
You took my chair.

76
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,576
No, I didn't.

77
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,244
I took back the chair
that you took from me.

78
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,545
But I didn't take your chair.

79
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,780
When you get up,

80
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,015
I'm just gonna take it back
anyway, so...

81
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,518
So I guess I can't get up.

82
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,636
Hey, Coselli!

83
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,938
The Coz!
The Cosby.

84
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,573
Hey, hey, hey!

85
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,309
I love Jell-O Pudding Pops!

86
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:08,580
My son Theo love
Jell-O Pudding Pops too.

87
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,383
Do you know where we are, Temp?

88
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,018
I know where we're not.

89
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,255
I hold in my hand a beet seed.

90
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,523
Take it.

91
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,524
Ah...

92
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,592
When you...

93
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,295
Damn it.

94
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,167
Hey, Big Tuna.

95
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,535
Can I talk to you for a second?

96
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,803
Sure.

97
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,739
Can you stand up

98
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,074
and talk to me over there?

99
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,545
That's it?

100
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,847
That's what you came up with?

101
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,316
I'm acting my heart out here.

102
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,351
- Really, huh?
- Yeah, really.

103
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,654
You asked for my help,
so I helped.

104
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,295
Attention, Scranton
Business Park.

105
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,763
There will be
complimentary pretzels

106
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:01,199
available in the lobby
from now until 4:00

107
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,635
as a thank-you
to our loyal tenants.

108
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,344
Once a year, they bring in
a little cart.

109
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,179
And they give away
free pretzels.

110
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,182
It's really not a big deal.

111
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,884
To some people it is.

112
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,452
Productivity is important.

113
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,487
But how can I be productive

114
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,156
if I have this one little
thing in my brain

115
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,791
that I cannot get out?

116
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,393
And that one little thing
is a soft pretzel.

117
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,128
So I'm just gonna have
my soft pretzel.

118
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,129
And I'll get to work.

119
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,531
And I'll be super productive.

120
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,632
Look out for me!

121
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,102
Oh, sh...

122
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,770
Come on.

123
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,817
And just as you have planted
your seed in the ground,

124
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,920
I am going to plant my seed
in you.

125
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,356
I don't think you know
what you're saying.

126
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,924
Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?

127
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,659
Uh-huh.

128
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,294
It's called bullcrap.

129
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,763
And a client can smell it
from a mile away.

130
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,498
Gotcha.

131
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,499
Oh, hey...

132
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,900
I forgot something in my car.

133
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,435
I'll be right back.

134
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,070
Okay.

135
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,052
Of course.

136
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,324
I wake up every morning
in a bed that's too small.

137
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,559
Drive my daughter to a school
that's too expensive.

138
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,261
And then I go to work to a job

139
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,130
for which I get paid too little.

140
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,799
But on pretzel day...

141
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,702
Well, I like pretzel day.

142
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,303
'Cause they're acting
all tough and everything.

143
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,272
But what they were
rapping about was cupcakes

144
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,607
and The Chronicles of Narnia.

145
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,909
Who invented cupcakes, right?

146
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,043
- I want to kill them.
- Hey!

147
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,111
Hey, Phyllis!

148
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,312
What are you doing?

149
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,747
I'm just saying hi to Bob.

150
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,382
No, I think you're
cutting in line.

151
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,850
Well, settle down, Scott.

152
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,352
No, I'm not gonna settle down.
No, no way.

153
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,787
- Uh-uh, boo!
- Get in the back, please.

154
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,289
- Boo!
- Back of the line!

155
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,524
Thank you!

156
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,292
Back of the line.

157
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,528
That's right.

158
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,096
What a pair of Marys.

159
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,864
This is pretzel day.

160
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,865
"Hey, Dwight,
you're a great salesman.

161
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:14,866
Can you teach me?"

162
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,034
"Sure, Ryan.

163
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,369
"I'll make you kneel
in cow manure.

164
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,438
And I'll abandon you
in a beet field."

165
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,039
"Oh, that sounds great, Dwight.

166
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,207
"I really appreciate that.

167
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,310
Thank you so much
for your mentorship."

168
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,818
Congratulations,
resourceful salesman.

169
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,754
You have passed
the second challenge.

170
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,523
Welcome to Schrute Farm!

171
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,047
It's gonna be
in my head all day.

172
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,215
Please?

173
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,787
This is not
a proportionate response.

174
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,203
Whatever happened to those guys?

175
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,274
Michael.

176
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,308
No cuts!

177
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,643
Oh, Pam.

178
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,978
Just the woman I'd like to see.

179
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,979
You read my mind.

180
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,013
Great.

181
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,581
I thought you might want
to use this time

182
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,682
to authorize some checks.

183
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,984
I thought that maybe you could

184
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,485
wait in line for me
while I go to the bathroom.

185
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,786
You're an angel.

186
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,722
Hey, why don't you just
go up to your office,

187
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:44,756
get some work done,

188
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:45,790
and I'll bring you a pretzel?

189
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,425
Because I like them
a certain way.

190
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,727
And if it gets screwed up,

191
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,695
then this whole thing's blown.

192
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,397
You know, I just think it's
really important that

193
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,899
you be productive today.

194
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,134
Pam, productivity starts with

195
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,336
patience and determination.

196
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,105
Okay.

197
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,414
It is time for your next test.

198
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,550
You have planted the beet seed.

199
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,352
You have walked the long,
lonely walk of loneliness.

200
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,353
Look, man.

201
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,855
I was in a frat in college.

202
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,590
So I know what you're doing.

203
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:19,591
I get it.

204
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:20,725
You know what your problem is?

205
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,460
You know why you haven't
made any sales?

206
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,895
Because you think
you know everything.

207
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,430
You have to trust that maybe

208
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,531
there are other people

209
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,166
that can teach you things.

210
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,669
Are you ready to learn?

211
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,672
Are you ready for
the final test?

212
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,673
Yeah.

213
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,874
Come on!

214
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,179
Thank you.

215
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,180
Hi, please tell me you have

216
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,181
a sweet pretzel left.

217
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,883
- We do.
- Thank God.

218
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,084
And we have
18 different toppings.

219
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,652
We have sweet glaze,
cinnamon sugar,

220
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,120
chocolate, white chocolate,

221
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,856
fudge, M&Ms, caramel dip,
mint chip, chocolate chip,

222
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,192
marshmallows, nuts,
toffee nuts, coconuts,

223
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,661
peanut butter drizzle, Oreos,
sprinkles, cotton candy bits,

224
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,696
and powdered sugar.

225
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,465
Is there any way
that you could do all?

226
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,466
All of them?

227
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,467
The works?
You got it.

228
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,768
All right!

229
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,103
Thank you.

230
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,006
Please be seated.

231
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,347
What was that?

232
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,581
Pay no attention to the spirits

233
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,949
that haunt this hallowed ground.

234
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,818
Is that your cousin Mose?

235
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,919
Yes.

236
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:24,389
Mose is my cousin,
and he lives here.

237
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,758
He will always be
my best friend.

238
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,426
Unless things go well
with Ryan today.

239
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,794
In which case
I won't hang out with Mose

240
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,096
so much anymore.

241
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:35,066
What is the greatest danger
facing Dunder-Mifflin?

242
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,136
Outsourcing and consolidation
of competition.

243
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,437
Wrong.
Flash floods.

244
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,606
What is the true cause

245
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,676
of Robert Mifflin's suicide?

246
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,045
Depression?

247
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,446
Wrong.
He hated himself.

248
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,283
What is the Dharma Initiative?

249
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,452
I can't believe that
Ryan is not back yet.

250
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,453
Where could they be?

251
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,188
Sales take a long time.

252
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,490
Oh, my God.
I'm so worried.

253
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,992
I'm sure Dwight
will protect him.

254
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,761
I don't know.
Dwight's so weird.

255
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,996
He's not weird.

256
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,898
He's just individualistic.

257
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,233
No, he's a freak.

258
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,501
You're a freak!

259
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,073
Final question,

260
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,475
young Ryan Howard.

261
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,047
What...

262
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:29,487
is Michael Scott's
greatest fear?

263
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,957
Um, loneliness.

264
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,492
Maybe women.

265
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,827
Wrong.

266
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,063
He's not afraid of anything.

267
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,498
Also, I would've accepted
snakes.

268
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,802
Fear is what it's all about.

269
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:47,405
You cannot sell
while undergoing fear.

270
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,041
You need to vanquish fear!

271
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:55,080
One must wrestle fear
to the ground.

272
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,215
You will now
wrestle my cousin Mose!

273
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,184
No!
Okay, all right!

274
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,418
Wrestle him to the ground!

275
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,486
This is over, okay?

276
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:02,620
You're a freak.

277
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,222
I'm not doing this anymore
and this is over.

278
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,557
- Ryan...
- Good-bye.

279
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,658
Ryan, you don't have
to wrestle him.

280
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,394
Ryan, just get in the coffin.

281
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,330
Ryan...

282
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,232
Bye, Ryan.

283
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,604
He seemed nice.

284
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,506
Where are all the animals?

285
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,610
Ryan, come on.
I am sorry.

286
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,045
I am sorry.

287
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,046
Mose is sorry too.

288
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,013
Look...

289
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,950
He sent over a basket with eggs

290
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,351
and some fat back bacon.

291
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,319
And look...

292
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,921
Something he whittled.

293
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,508
You still mad?

294
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,147
It's just...

295
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,182
Jim and I didn't get along.

296
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,986
And... I didn't want it
to be that way again.

297
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,389
You know, I wanted us
to be a team.

298
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,057
An unstoppable team

299
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,559
that competed against
other teams.

300
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,628
Look, that's not
what I wanted, okay?

301
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,564
I just wanted
to go on a sales call.

302
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,534
Screw gun!
The sales call!

303
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,361
Mr. Coselli.

304
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,462
Hey, hey, hey!

305
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,464
The Cos!
What's going on?

306
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,632
Do we have a deal?

307
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,134
Deal or no deal?

308
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,502
Let's make a deal.

309
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,137
So what is the deal?

310
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,338
Establish time frames.

311
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,807
Keep the phrase "real dollars"
in their heads.

312
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,642
And always keep the power
in the conversation.

313
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,377
That's why you're losing them
on the cold calls.

314
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,847
Because you say
the word "please" too much.

315
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,148
Wait, can you go back?

316
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,016
Michael always says
K-I-S-S.

317
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,685
"Keep it simple, stupid."

318
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,819
Great advice.

319
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,654
Hurts my feelings every time.

320
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,257
Okay, I'm gonna
establish time frames.

321
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,558
Good.

322
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,793
I'm gonna put everything
in terms of real dollars.

323
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:22,861
Right.

324
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,995
I'm gonna ask a lot of questions

325
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,463
that all have sort of
positive answers.

326
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,497
So they'll say
"That would be better" or

327
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,532
"We would like that."

328
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,733
Exactly, yes, good.

329
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,201
I'm going to try to be confident

330
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,269
but not cocky.

331
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,839
Oh, hey, everyone.

332
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,908
I am officially streamlining
the efficiency

333
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,476
of this corporation.

334
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,944
- Second...
- Second?

335
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,246
Yes, second, Toby.

336
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,015
Second, I am insisting
on increased accountability

337
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,216
from every single one of you.

338
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,985
Account...
Michael, what's going on?

339
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,286
And I will be taking questions.

340
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,121
Did you have a lot of
sugar today, Michael?

341
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,289
What's on your suit?

342
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,357
Caramel dip.

343
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,558
But one question
at a time, please.

344
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,026
Phyllis, Stanley...

345
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,194
I want you to switch desks.

346
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,829
I'm going to reorganize

347
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,731
and restructure
the physical layout

348
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,332
of the office to
maximize everything.

349
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,401
I think we're getting
a lot done, don't you?

350
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,502
On paper, at least.

351
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,404
And we are, after all,
a paper company.

352
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,805
Are we not?
Are we not?

353
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:08,840
Are we not?
Are you with me?

354
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,808
Are you with me?
Thank you very much.

355
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,779
They really didn't like me.

356
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,080
They did not.

357
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,283
But they didn't have to
say it to your face.

358
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,784
I don't get it.

359
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,719
I don't get what I did wrong.

360
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,388
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan.

361
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,455
Sometimes you just fail.

362
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,457
It's those online paper jerks.

363
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,493
The whole business is changing.

364
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,527
You know what?

365
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,528
They're gonna be screwed

366
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,397
once this whole
Internet fad is over.

367
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,232
What are you doing?
Oh, no!

368
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:37,568
No, no, no!
No, Ryan!

369
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,338
Yes!
Ryan the Temp, yeah!

370
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,441
Come on, come on!

371
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,442
Courtesy of Dunder-Mifflin!

372
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,677
Oh, come on!

373
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,846
- Drive!
- You drive!

374
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,885
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Pam.

375
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:54,953
Oh, hi, Jan.

376
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,890
He's, uh, on a sales call.

377
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,358
No message?

378
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,027
Bye, Jan.

379
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,875
Temp! Temp!

380
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,777
Temp! Temp...

381
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,679
Ryan! Ryan!

382
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,414
Ryan! Ryan!

383
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,582
Yes!

384
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,150
Just think.

385
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,685
That temp agency
could've sent you anywhere.

386
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,022
I think about that all the time.

387
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,327
- Good night, Pam.
- Good night.

388
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,829
Hey, what time is it?

389
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,097
5:20.

390
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,098
AM or PM?

391
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,232
PM.

392
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,834
Oh, good.

393
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:43,835
These came for you.

394
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,236
Contracts.

395
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,237
Brent Coselli.

396
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,774
Oh, Coselli.
With the Jell-O.

397
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,142
This is a huge sale.

398
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,444
Yes, right.
Good.

399
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:56,914
Good night, Michael.

400
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,583
Good night.

401
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,356
Dunder-Mifflin.

402
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,357
Oh, hey.

403
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,558
Oh, my God.

404
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,893
Hi.

405
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,061
Hi.

406
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,696
Sorry, I forgot
Kevin's extension.

407
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,297
It's a fantasy football thing.

408
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,499
Oh.

409
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,733
And I was just gonna
go through the system

410
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,569
because I didn't think
you'd be there.

411
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,038
Why are you still there?

412
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,407
I had to work late.

413
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,042
Jan's making me keep a log

414
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,676
of everything Michael does
all day.

415
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,879
Wow.

416
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,550
Do you think you could
send me a copy of that?

417
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,385
Yeah, totally.

418
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,257
So...
So...

419
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,059
- Do you...
- Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.

420
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,827
Uh, no...
I, um...

421
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,029
Everything's pretty much
the same here.

422
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,030
Oh, good.

423
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,232
A little different.

424
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,435
What time is it there?

425
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,438
What time is it here?

426
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,874
We're in the same time zone.

427
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,510
Oh, yeah.
Right.

428
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,512
How far away did you think
we were?

429
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,848
I don't know.
It felt far.

430
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,519
Yeah.

431
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,555
- I have a question for you.
- What?

432
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,290
How many words per minute

433
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,225
does the average person type?

434
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,326
I type 90.

435
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,061
Shut up.

436
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,830
Mavis Beacon doesn't even
type 90.

437
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,098
It's true.

438
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,532
Okay, I said average.

439
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,533
70?

440
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,534
How many do you type?

441
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,669
Forget it.

442
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,771
I was just about to brag.
Forget it.

443
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,506
- Come on, tell me.
- No.

444
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,041
You have to tell me now.

445
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,075
65.

446
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,846
Okay, no need to laugh.

447
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,482
No, it's...
That's respectable.

448
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,583
Respectable?

449
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,085
So, okay,
I'm watching the movie.

450
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,921
By myself, because I just wanted

451
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,456
a relaxing evening at home.

452
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,392
Okay.

453
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,560
And I'm freaking out!

454
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,595
Yeah.

455
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:51,596
That movie is so scary.

456
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,597
I know.

457
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,031
But I'm holding on

458
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,167
because I keep waiting
for Sandra Bullock to show up.

459
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,568
No way!

460
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,906
How do you confuse 28 Days
with 28 Days Later?

461
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,107
Because I got it at Blockbuster

462
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,575
and they don't put
the pictures on the box.

463
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,911
You're making this up.

464
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,646
Would I make that up?

465
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,148
Yes!

466
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,150
Fancy New Beesly
would make that up.

467
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,951
New apartment, new stories...

468
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,621
Oh, yeah,
My fancy new apartment.

469
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,258
I have one bedroom,
one bathroom, and a closet.

470
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,425
And how many kitchens?

471
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,560
I have one kitchen.

472
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,562
Wow, you got totally taken

473
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,097
for a ride, Beesly.

474
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,965
It's actually...

475
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,468
Most apartments these days
have, like, three.

476
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,469
Three kitchens?

477
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,371
Yes.

478
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,539
How are you gonna cook

479
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,973
every meal of the day
in one kitchen?

480
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,508
Hey, Ryan.
Are you okay?

481
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,143
Pam?

482
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,078
Yeah. Yeah.

483
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,446
Pam?

484
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,248
Um, okay.

485
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,516
Bye.

486
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,552
Oh, yeah.
I should probably...

487
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,053
Oh, no...
I was, um...

488
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,054
I don't know.

489
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,622
- You have to go?
- Yeah.

490
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,623
No, I should probably go too.

491
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,724
Okay.

492
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,860
I mean, yeah.

493
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,928
Yeah.

494
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,898
Bye, Pam.

495
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,301
Bye, Jim.

496
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,296
364 days...
Until the next pretzel day.
