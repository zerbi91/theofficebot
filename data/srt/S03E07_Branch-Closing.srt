1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,403
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,605
Who are you faxing so early
in the morning?

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,940
Oh, um...

4
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,143
Kinda hard to explain.

5
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:12,845
I don't have a ton of contact

6
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,813
with the Scranton branch,

7
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:15,914
but before I left,

8
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,584
I took a box
of Dwight's stationery.

9
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:22,321
So from time to time,
I send Dwight faxes.

10
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,156
From himself.

11
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,191
From the future.

12
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,493
"Dwight,

13
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,429
"At 8:00 A.M. today,
someone poisons the coffee.

14
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,464
"Do not drink the coffee.

15
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,400
"More instructions will follow.

16
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,702
"Cordially, Future Dwight"

17
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,309
Nooo!

18
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,311
You'll thank me later.

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,246
There she is.

20
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,448
- Jan Levinson.
- Michael.

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,449
First thing in the morning.

22
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,384
I love to start my day

23
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,586
with a hearty bowl of Jan.

24
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,255
- Michael.
- Just call me Levinson.

25
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,091
In the morning.

26
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:34,193
Baby.

27
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,261
- Michael.
- Yes.

28
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,966
I'm here to tell you
that we are closing

29
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,501
the Scranton branch.

30
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,405
I don't understand.

31
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,440
The board voted last night
to close your branch.

32
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,977
On whom's authority?

33
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,979
The board's.

34
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,716
W-what?

35
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,418
I'm very sorry.
I-I... pssh.

36
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,452
I don't relish

37
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,154
telling you this.

38
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,990
Uh, you've been a big part
of this company.

39
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,226
And the board asked me
to thank you

40
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:09,628
for your years of service.

41
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,929
You're welcome.

42
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,097
A small number of people
will be transferred

43
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,432
to the Stamford branch,

44
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,467
and the rest will be getting
severance packages.

45
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,472
Am I a small number person
or a severance package person?

46
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,840
Well, we haven't made

47
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:26,211
final decisions
about personnel yet.

48
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,379
But you're a severance
package person.

49
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,717
Oh, my God.

50
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,753
Oh, my God!

51
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,724
No!

52
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,830
What are they talking about?

53
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,598
I don't know.

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,233
Is it serious?

55
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,169
I don't know, Kev.

56
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,337
If you find out anything...

57
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,375
Call me.

58
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,478
You got it, buddy.

59
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,656
You all right, Michael?

60
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,991
Do you want me
to get you some water

61
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,760
or a tissue?

62
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,297
All right.

63
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,631
You know what, I don't get it.

64
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,101
I don't...

65
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,305
I don't get it.

66
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,806
Because our numbers
aren't that bad.

67
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,174
Things are looking up.

68
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,809
It's not all
about numbers, Michael.

69
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,511
- Well...
- It's... it's about talent.

70
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,646
Oh, you gotta...
Josh?

71
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,215
Our CFO believes

72
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,317
- that Josh is going to play an important role...
- Josh.

73
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,318
In our company's future.

74
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,719
Oh, really?
What role is that?

75
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,188
- Yes, really.
- King of the stupid universe?

76
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,223
Okay.

77
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,290
Don't do this...

78
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,925
I... I think
we're finished.

79
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,993
And I need to go...

80
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,428
We are not...

81
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,364
I would appreciate it if you
would please use discretion

82
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,632
until we get our ducks in a row.

83
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,701
I know you're mad,
but don't do this to me.

84
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,470
I know...
I know I hurt you.

85
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,105
But please do not do this to me.

86
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,607
Don't hurt me like I hurt you.

87
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,644
Jan.

88
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,379
Jan.

89
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,251
It is an outrage.

90
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,518
That's all.

91
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,953
It's...

92
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,590
They're making a huge,
huge mistake.

93
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,493
Let's see Josh
replace these people.

94
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,564
Let's see Josh
find another Stanley.

95
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,099
You think Stanleys
grow on trees?

96
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,533
Well, they don't.

97
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,868
There is no Stanley tree.

98
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,173
Do you think the world
is crawling with Phyllises?

99
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,643
Show me that farm.

100
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,379
With Phyllises and Kevins
sprouting up

101
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,948
all over the place,
ripe for the plucking.

102
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,287
Show me that farm.

103
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,356
Pictures.

104
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,192
Memories.

105
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,294
Look at that.

106
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,028
They grow up so fast.

107
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,500
Hey, stranger.
Don't say that.

108
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,502
That just sounds weird.
Please.

109
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,004
Sorry, I just feel like
we haven't talked in a while.

110
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,674
Well, we have nothing
to talk about, Dwight.

111
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,776
Just do your work.

112
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,077
While you still can.

113
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,389
When you become close
with someone,

114
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,692
you develop a kind
of sixth sense.

115
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,094
You can read their moods
like a book.

116
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,129
Right now, the title
of Michael's book

117
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,267
is Something Weird Is Going On.

118
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,202
Colon:

119
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,271
What Did Jan Say?

120
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,076
The Michael Scott Story.

121
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,844
By Michael Scott.

122
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,646
With Dwight Schrute.

123
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,781
Hey, um, did you hear
about your friends

124
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,550
in Pennsylvania?

125
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,552
Rumor has it that
the Scranton branch is "gklch."

126
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,754
Really?

127
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:56,988
Wow, that's too bad.

128
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,557
Um...

129
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,558
Sorry.

130
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,060
Scranton branch is closing?

131
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,229
In your face.

132
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,465
Well, I work here now.

133
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,400
Mmmm! Sucka.

134
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,675
Are you okay?
D... Yeah.

135
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,577
Great, amazing.

136
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,545
Best physical condition
of my life.

137
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,347
What did Jan want?

138
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,117
Nothing.
Just checking in.

139
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,453
I can't tell you, so.

140
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,688
What can't you tell me?

141
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,124
Nothing.
Pam.

142
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,392
What difference does it make?

143
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,559
We'll all be gone
in a few weeks anyway.

144
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,161
- What?
- What?

145
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,562
You just said
that we're gonna be gone...

146
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,363
Do I have any messages?

147
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,398
Michael, what's going on?

148
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,599
What did Jan say to you?

149
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,867
- Nothing.
- Was she mean to you?

150
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,201
No, she...

151
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,336
Okay.
Okay.

152
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,904
Listen up, everybody.

153
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,873
I have some news.

154
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,345
All I can do right now
is put on a brave face

155
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,414
and go out there
and be their leader.

156
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,517
It's over.

157
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,119
We are screwed.

158
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,321
Dunder-Mifflin Scranton
is being shut down.

159
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,457
Michael, uh...

160
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,525
We shouldn't be talking
about this

161
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,427
until all the decisions
have been made.

162
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,297
You knew about this
all along, didn't you?

163
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,634
Jan told me just a few minutes
before she told you.

164
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,068
Traitor.

165
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,303
You are a traitor.

166
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,938
What about us, Michael?
Do we still have jobs?

167
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,939
I don't know.

168
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,875
Probably not.

169
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,077
This is the worst.

170
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,322
So this has been great.

171
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,623
So let's get back to work

172
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,692
and do the best job that we can.

173
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,628
Toby, I'd like to see you
in my office, please.

174
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,464
All right.

175
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,770
Oh, my God, you walk so slowly.

176
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,613
It makes perfect sense
that it would happen today

177
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,683
because I just received this
in the mail.

178
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05,784
1,000 business cards

179
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:08,253
with this address
and phone number.

180
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,289
I don't want to blame anyone
in particular.

181
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,291
I think everyone's to blame.

182
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,228
If I get to stay
and Ryan is laid off,

183
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,363
I will kill myself.

184
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,565
Like Romeo and Juliet.

185
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,000
The Claire Danes one.

186
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,174
What happened?

187
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,309
I think the word got out
about Scranton.

188
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,512
Hm...

189
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,780
Hey, uh, do you know
any more details on that?

190
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,416
Like, is, uh,
anybody transferring here?

191
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,985
Yeah, nothing's definite.

192
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,286
In fact, you know what.

193
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,288
Um, excuse me, everyone.

194
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,223
I know there are
some rumors going around,

195
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,492
but nothing is definite,
all right?

196
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,494
Um, you guys
have done a great job

197
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,463
getting our numbers up
around here,

198
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,964
but until this thing
is official,

199
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,132
let's just keep working.

200
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,834
Huh, yeah?
Be professional.

201
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:56,935
Ladies and gentlemen,

202
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,704
our fearless leader,
Josh Porter.

203
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,907
Josh, take a bow.
Take a bow.

204
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,576
I think
it would be kind of weird

205
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,778
if everyone from Scranton
came here.

206
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,446
It'd be like, uh,

207
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,048
going to
your high school reunion,

208
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,650
and you saying,
"Hey, I missed you guys."

209
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,318
And then they're all like,
"Oh, don't worry about it.

210
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,921
"We're all
gonna move in with you...

211
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,289
forever."

212
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,562
Yeah?

213
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,563
Hey.

214
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,231
Meredith, hello.

215
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,232
Tough day.

216
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,433
Yes.

217
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,467
So listen,

218
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,136
I know you're seeing someone,

219
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,972
but I'm still willing
if you are.

220
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,374
What... willing?

221
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,676
You remember.

222
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,178
Like six years ago we said
that on our last day of work

223
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,514
that we would...

224
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,782
sleep together.

225
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,284
Oh...

226
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:49,454
God, uh,

227
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,723
um, I did not say that.

228
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,992
Was that not you?

229
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,294
No, not... not me.

230
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,763
Oh.

231
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,832
Never mind.

232
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,837
Day just gets worse and worse.

233
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,139
It's a blessing in disguise.

234
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,775
Actually, not even in disguise.

235
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,210
In my fantasy,

236
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,945
I always thought
I would slap someone,

237
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,949
make a big speech
and storm out forever.

238
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,784
But this is good too.

239
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,853
- You're kidding.
- No.

240
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,455
Wh... What does that mean?

241
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,924
Well, some of us are fired.

242
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,927
And a few are going
to Connecticut.

243
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,497
Do you guys know
who's going where?

244
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,800
Oh, don't worry.
You're gonna be fine, Roy.

245
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,202
You're very... strong.

246
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,503
And capable.

247
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,038
Thanks.

248
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,175
Oh, grow up.

249
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,845
I don't wanna work here
without Pam.

250
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,013
That'd just be like

251
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,515
loading trucks
without any meaning.

252
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,850
You know?

253
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,785
I couldn't be happier.

254
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,553
I'm gonna take the severance
and retire.

255
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,689
My wife and I are gonna travel.

256
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,392
I really couldn't be happier.

257
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,863
Feeling nostalgic?

258
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,399
Yeah, nostalgic.

259
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,380
- Hey, Mike.
- Darrel.

260
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:23,415
Noble Darrel.

261
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,585
- Look, I heard about the office.
- Oh.

262
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,586
- Tough break.
- I know.

263
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,088
I know.

264
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,189
Well, I'll land on my feet.

265
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,924
Yeah.
Don't worry about me.

266
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,259
I wasn't.

267
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,560
So you'll be okay too.

268
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,063
You're a warrior.
You're smart, capable.

269
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,964
You'll find something else,
and...

270
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,667
Actually, Bob Vance bought out
the warehouse.

271
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,002
So he's keeping on
the whole crew.

272
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,070
So we're good.

273
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,573
Awesome.

274
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,575
This is my house.

275
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,278
The CFO's taking away my house
and giving it to Josh.

276
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,716
And Josh is giving the garage
to Bob Vance.

277
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,052
Pah.

278
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,388
All right, listen up.

279
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,689
Some of you may have heard

280
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,225
some rumors
about the branch closing.

281
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,761
Um, like when you said
the branch was closing?

282
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,296
But I am not

283
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,264
going to take this lying down.

284
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,332
I have a plan,

285
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,633
and I am going to save our jobs.

286
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,102
So just hang in there.
Let's go.

287
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,570
Yes!

288
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,971
Oh, good.
You're bringing Dwight.

289
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,673
Yes.
This might get ugly.

290
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,742
I'm gonna need backup.

291
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,577
What's the plan?

292
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,611
Go to New York.

293
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,146
Confront the CFO.

294
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,115
Show him he's making a mistake.
Save the branch.

295
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,883
- Can I drive?
- No way.

296
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,884
Shotgun!

297
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,219
No, there's no one else.

298
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,854
Still.

299
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,756
Thank you very much.
Okay.

300
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,924
- Secretary says Wallace is away for the day...
- Agh.

301
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,026
And won't be coming back
into the office.

302
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,661
Okay, okay.
Um...

303
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:44,896
But...

304
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,164
do not worry.

305
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,832
I have his home address...

306
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,768
right here.

307
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,035
Why?

308
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,670
Christmas card list.

309
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,005
You send him cards?

310
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,173
You've never met him.

311
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,241
Well, when I do,

312
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,109
we'll have something
to talk about.

313
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,980
Hey, do you have a second?

314
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,615
Sure, what's up?

315
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,450
I-I know it's not definite,
or whatever,

316
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,919
but, uh, do you know
who's coming over here

317
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,320
from Scranton?

318
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,522
I honestly don't.
I don't know.

319
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:11,723
Okay.

320
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,425
So is it, like, sales
or... accountants or...

321
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,261
You know what, Jim?
I wouldn't worry about it.

322
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,263
What does that mean?

323
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,764
- Hi.
- Jan, hey.

324
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,332
Oh, good, you're both here.

325
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,801
Ready to talk logistics?

326
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,438
I just feel like it could have
been something special

327
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,607
if we could have kept
working together.

328
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,142
But...

329
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,143
I'm gonna go someplace else,

330
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,113
and you're gonna go
someplace else.

331
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,848
It just doesn't make sense.

332
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,317
This kind of worked out
perfectly for me.

333
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,085
I got some good experience.

334
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:44,522
Um, Michael's gonna write me
a great recommendation.

335
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:48,459
And as far as
me and Kelly goes...

336
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,595
I think it's for the best.

337
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,839
Okay.

338
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,041
This is it.

339
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,410
This is exactly
what Michael Moore does.

340
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,012
Famous documentarian.

341
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,381
He goes up to people
with a camera,

342
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,549
and he's like,

343
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,851
"Why did you do this?

344
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,118
"Why did you pollute?

345
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,287
You are bad.
You're a bad person."

346
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,322
It's very dramatic.

347
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,590
Although I can't say
I was a big fan

348
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,425
of Bowling For Columbine.

349
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,759
Because I thought it
was gonna be

350
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,894
a bowling movie.

351
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,562
Like Kingpin.

352
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,703
And it wasn't.
It was something else.

353
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,273
So.

354
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,442
Josh will be running
what is now called

355
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,077
Dunder-Mifflin Northeast,

356
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,179
which is all the offices
north of Stamford.

357
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,447
And Jim, if you want the job,

358
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,182
you'll be his number two.

359
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,950
Wow. Uh, sure.
Absolutely.

360
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,151
- Awesome. - 'Scuse me, Jan.
I'm sorry.

361
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,319
I'm gonna have
to stop you there.

362
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,755
I, um...

363
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,657
will not be taking the job.

364
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,691
W...

365
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,726
Excu... why not?

366
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,562
As of today, I have accepted

367
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,131
a senior management position
at Staples.

368
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,733
Today.

369
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,067
Mm-hmm.

370
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,802
You leveraged your new position
with us

371
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:05,937
into another offer?

372
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,572
Damn it, Josh.

373
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,309
This whole restructuring thing
was based around keeping you.

374
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,577
I...

375
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,279
I'm sorry, all right?
It's done.

376
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,280
It's done.

377
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,547
I gotta make some calls.

378
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,415
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, Jim.

379
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,521
Say what you will
about Michael Scott.

380
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,058
But he would never do that.

381
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,826
Okay.

382
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,828
All visible
points of access are covered.

383
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,764
So.

384
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,232
Do you know
what you're gonna say

385
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,533
when he shows up?

386
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,801
I will improvise.

387
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,936
I will speak from the heart.

388
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,504
No.
Bad idea.

389
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,406
You need an attack plan.

390
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,341
Here, I'll be him.
You be you.

391
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,342
Let's practice.

392
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,044
Okay.

393
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,178
All right.

394
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,548
- Coming home from work.
- 'Scuse me.

395
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,849
Mr. Wallace?
David Wallace?

396
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,151
Yes?
What is the meaning of this?

397
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:57,088
Can you tell us why
you are shutting down Scranton

398
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,657
and putting 15 people
out of work?

399
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,993
Well, the branch is no longer
financially viable.

400
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,494
It's simple dollars and cents.

401
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,663
Yes, but these
are employees, sir.

402
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:06,664
These are human beings.

403
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,966
Listen, Scott.

404
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,934
It's no longer
financially viable.

405
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,269
We're losing money, okay?

406
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,204
It's not a charity.
It's a business.

407
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,139
And it's a dying business.

408
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,343
Look, the whole business model

409
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,644
of the small regional
paper company

410
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,778
simply doesn't
make sense anymore.

411
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,080
Stop... stop it.
Just...

412
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,348
Okay, he's not gonna say
any of that.

413
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,682
It...
Wh... hey, why not?

414
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,718
Because he'd be intimidated.
And I just...

415
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,852
Let's start again.

416
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,921
- Just be more scared of me, okay?
- Okay.

417
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,823
Don't touch me this time.

418
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,525
- Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
- Coming home from w... Agh!

419
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,995
Pam, would you please sign
my company directory?

420
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,197
Are you serious?

421
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,732
Sure.

422
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,510
"Kelly, best wishes.
Love, Pam"?

423
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,747
"P.S.

424
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,716
What a long, strange trip
it's been."

425
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,095
So we are still scrambling
here, but, uh...

426
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,263
Mm-hmm?

427
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,166
It looks like Scranton
is going to absorb Stamford.

428
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,200
Wow.

429
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,036
And I know that you
just left there

430
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,303
couple of months ago,

431
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,305
but we would like to offer you
the number two position

432
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,340
at that branch.

433
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,608
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

434
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,542
Um...

435
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,345
No, it's just,
I'm not sure if I, um...

436
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,913
Well, to be quite honest
with you, Jan,

437
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,349
I-I have a few unpleasant
memories of Scranton.

438
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,551
And, um...

439
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,585
Michael.

440
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,753
No, no, no.

441
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,523
Just, um, some personal stuff.

442
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,858
And I'm not really ready
to revisit that,

443
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,160
I don't think.

444
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,594
Ah.

445
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,496
Well.

446
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,664
Please think about it.

447
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,899
And call me.

448
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,700
We will do whatever we can
to get you to stay.

449
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,035
Okay.

450
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,577
Hey, Meredith,
how you holding up?

451
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,878
I'm fine.

452
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
Hey, did we
ever have a conversation

453
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,549
about doing something
on the last day of work?

454
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,017
Does that ring a bell?

455
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,952
No, I don't think so.

456
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,587
Do you remember
hearing a rumor about me

457
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,323
and anybody, last day of work?

458
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,392
Something sexual?

459
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,594
No.

460
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,663
Okay.

461
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,301
I'm kind of
okay with it actually.

462
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:27,939
Oh, that's good.
That's... That's great.

463
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,408
Um, do you know
what you're gonna do then?

464
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,511
Well, you know,
I've got art school.

465
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,745
Oh, that's...

466
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,215
Yeah, of course,
you should totally do that.

467
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,549
That's a great idea.

468
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,152
Yeah, um...

469
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,621
I am already.

470
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,624
I started a while ago.

471
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:51,095
Wow, that's...
that's terrific.

472
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,998
That's awesome.

473
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,034
Well, cool.

474
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,469
I'm glad you're doing that.

475
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,542
You can learn a great deal about
a man from his trash.

476
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,146
Case in point:

477
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,214
Satellite TV bill.

478
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,649
Hm, lesson learned:

479
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,651
He's rich.

480
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,654
Hm...

481
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,723
Coffee grounds.

482
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,792
Was he enjoying
a delicious hot beverage?

483
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:25,296
Or disguising
the scent of cocaine

484
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:29,233
from drug-sniffing dogs?

485
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,436
It's a nice house.

486
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,005
Hey, guys.

487
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,840
Uh, I'm trying to organize
a little group lunch

488
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,675
for everybody, since, you know,

489
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,510
we're never gonna see
each other again.

490
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,179
Where are we going?

491
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,947
I thought maybe DJ's?

492
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:43,981
Mmm...

493
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,349
How 'bout Cugino's?

494
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,585
I don't wanna go
all the way to Dunmore.

495
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,420
How 'bout Cooper's, then?

496
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,721
No seafood.

497
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,558
Well, I don't want
to go to DJ's.

498
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,359
Oh, now, all of a sudden,
you get picky?

499
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,962
Okay.
Forget it.

500
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,364
Hooters.

501
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,732
No.

502
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,868
400 for the CPU.

503
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,003
Done.

504
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,481
Ah!
Here.

505
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,484
Replenish your fluids.

506
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,627
Where's Michael?

507
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,295
He's not here.

508
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,297
I don't know where he is.

509
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,765
What d...

510
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,969
What's going on here?

511
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,004
We know the branch is closing.

512
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,405
Michael told us.

513
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,907
Oh, God.

514
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,343
Okay.
You know what, everybody?

515
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,345
I'm sure there is
a better way to do this,

516
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,280
but I've driven something
like 400 miles today,

517
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,648
and I'm completely exhausted.

518
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,649
So I'm just gonna tell you.

519
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,251
Your branch is not closing.

520
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,285
Stamford is closing.

521
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,988
Um, for the time being, it seems

522
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,656
that all of your jobs are safe.

523
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,657
Yes.

524
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:00,925
Yeah!

525
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,326
Stanley.

526
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,427
Is it because of Michael?

527
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,463
Did he actually do something?

528
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,466
Well, reasons are not important.

529
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,134
Would you just call him, please,
wherever he is,

530
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,135
and tell him?

531
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,670
Sure.
Uh, Jan.

532
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,305
Um, do you know... is anyone
coming back to Scranton?

533
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,539
Back?

534
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,907
Coming to Scranton.

535
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:17,942
Is anyone coming to Scranton?

536
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,378
Uh, y... we don't know.

537
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,647
Probably a few.

538
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,922
Maybe we should take a break,

539
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,324
get some food.

540
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,192
Negative.
We could miss him.

541
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,360
I'm really hungry.

542
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,499
Who is it?

543
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,600
The office.

544
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,402
- Are you gonna get it?
- No.

545
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:49,507
Not until I have
some good news for them.

546
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,742
Not until I have some good news.

547
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,046
Bulum-bulum-bump-
Belum-bump.

548
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,881
Dunder-Mifflin Action News.

549
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,183
Jim Halpert,

550
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,519
will Big Tuna
be transferring to Scranton?

551
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,688
Oh, I don't know.

552
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,922
Jan offered me the job,

553
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,891
and I haven't
really decided yet.

554
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,426
Yeah, well, even if
I don't get transferred,

555
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,529
I'll probably be fine.

556
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:15,900
Cornell has an extensive
alumni network so...

557
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,836
We look out for each other.

558
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,604
Probably go back
and teach or something.

559
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,206
Where'd you go to college?

560
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,875
Hm, Cornell.

561
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:27,044
Oh...

562
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,546
That's good.

563
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,684
I guess some new people
might be coming from Stamford.

564
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,454
Should be fun.
New blood.

565
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:37,822
Is Jim coming back?

566
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,957
That's, um...

567
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,592
I hadn't thought about it.

568
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,361
I don't know.
Huh.

569
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,628
I just don't want it
to be weird.

570
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,731
You know?

571
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:47,765
I mean,

572
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,133
I took his old job

573
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,468
and his old desk.

574
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,303
Yeah, yeah, that might be weird.

575
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:55,373
Overall, though,

576
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,241
we still all have our jobs,
so good news, right?

577
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:57,908
Oh, yeah.
Totally.

578
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,745
I'm so happy!

579
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,646
We don't have
to break up now, Ryan!

580
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,248
Mm, mm, mm!

581
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,616
It is the best day
of my whole life.

582
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:09,887
I don't know.

583
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,722
I can't explain it.

584
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,364
What are you gonna do?

585
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,833
I really don't know.

586
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,001
How you doing with all this?

587
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,936
You know, I'm fine.

588
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,472
I'll be better when I know
if I have a job.

589
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,242
You'd actually move to Scranton?

590
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,543
Yeah, if they let me.

591
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,844
I think I...
I think I would.

592
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:37,615
New York City is 45 minutes
down the road from here.

593
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,950
And you wanna move to Scranton.

594
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,419
I don't know.

595
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,254
If I were you,
I'd move to New York.

596
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,824
Yeah, you know, I...
I might do that.

597
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:47,958
I mi... who knows?

598
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,294
I... I might do that.

599
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,167
Guh!
K-k-kah!

600
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,273
Hey, Andy.

601
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,274
What's up, Josh?

602
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,442
Hey, man, just wanted
to say thanks.

603
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,443
Good luck.

604
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,444
Thanks, man.
You, too.

605
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,511
Totally.

606
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,382
Oh, well, what can you do?

607
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:13,150
It was nice
to have those few hours

608
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,351
when I thought it was over.

609
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:19,256
Now I have something
to look forward to.

610
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,659
Hey, Creed, congratulations.

611
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:22,660
Thank you.

612
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:26,096
Made like 1,200 bucks.

613
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,131
Meredith Palmer.

614
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,332
Hey, gorgeous.

615
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,633
Who's this?

616
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,602
Gary Trendel, from the old days.

617
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:32,703
Worked in the warehouse.

618
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:33,971
Oh, hey.

619
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,706
Hey, yeah, listen,
I heard through the grapevine

620
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,141
that your branch is closing,

621
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,478
and it got me to thinking
about our deal, remember?

622
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,746
Oh, yes.

623
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:46,050
Well, actually, the branch is...

624
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,185
Can you be at my place
in 20 minutes?

625
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:51,522
Yes, I can.

626
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:52,289
Anything?

627
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,793
Nothing.

628
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,095
What if this doesn't work?

629
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:01,098
What if the office
actually goes under?

630
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,736
Then it was an honor
to have worked with you.

631
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,515
All right.

632
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:22,319
Favorite moments
in Dunder-Mifflin history.

633
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,320
Go.

634
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:26,490
My first day, when you hazed me

635
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,692
by spraying me
with a fire extinguisher.

636
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,197
That was hilarious.

637
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,665
The foam.

638
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,902
Um, my first sale.
Uh-huh.

639
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:41,105
My promotion to assistant
regional manager.

640
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,540
Our basketball game.

641
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,841
Uh-huh.

642
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,878
And when you took me
to the hospital...

643
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,014
and told me
that you cared about me.

644
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,349
Oh, right. Okay.

645
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,051
That's enough.
That's good.

646
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,655
What were your favorite moments?

647
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:00,224
Oh...

648
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,092
All of 'em.

649
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,761
I loved 'em all.

650
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,996
Every single one.

651
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:09,233
What about when Jan said
the branch was closing?

652
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,401
God, Dwight.

653
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,536
Well, I just...

654
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,105
Hey, Pam.

655
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,273
We're going to Poor Richard's.

656
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,775
Creed's buying shots.

657
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,009
No, thanks, guys.

658
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,110
- All right.
- Have fun, though.

659
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,111
Cool.

660
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,846
Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.

661
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,715
Really?
Where did you hear that?

662
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,317
- Well, I was...
- Hey, Ryan, you coming?

663
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,384
Uh, yeah, we'll meet you there.

664
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,253
Awesome.
Let's go.

665
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,321
I'll tell you later.

666
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:31,722
Okay.

667
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,793
Hi.

668
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,630
Crazy day, huh?

669
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,632
Yeah.
Yeah.

670
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,000
Man.

671
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,771
I'm, uh...

672
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,541
I'm really glad you're still
gonna be working here.

673
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:53,744
Yeah, me, too.

674
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,212
I mean, it'd...

675
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,848
It's be a pain to have
to find another job so...

676
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,183
Yeah.

677
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:01,986
Totally.

678
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,624
All right, I'll see ya.

679
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,525
Okay.

680
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,361
I was expecting a severance.

681
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:13,497
Some time off.

682
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,366
But, um, maybe this is good.

683
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:17,735
Finding another job is a pain.

684
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,204
There's another annoying boss,

685
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,438
another desk.

686
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,742
I'd have to learn everything
all over again.

687
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,710
So...

688
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:29,513
there are reasons to stay.

689
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,923
Hey, um...

690
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:42,326
I think I am
gonna take that job.

691
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,327
And...

692
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,262
Scranton?

693
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:46,430
It's not that bad.

694
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:51,301
So if they offer you
a job there...

695
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,469
I think you should take it.

696
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,239
Okay, yeah.
Maybe I will.

697
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,374
Okay.

698
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:58,809
Yeah, I'm...
I'm happy he said that.

699
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:01,412
I mean, I don't think
he's into me or anything.

700
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:02,946
But...

701
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,249
I'm kind of into him.

702
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,317
So... there you go.

703
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,860
What are we still doing here?

704
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,630
It's over.

705
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:20,764
Let's go home.

706
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,499
Get the car.

707
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,707
Ohhh, this was such
a stupid idea.

708
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,743
This was so stupid.

709
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:35,679
I'm such a stupid idiot.

710
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,014
I let everybody down.

711
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,816
Everybody hates me.

712
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:42,486
I lost everybody's jobs.

713
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,455
Nobody likes me anymore!

714
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:45,456
Oh, my God!

715
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,590
What?

716
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:47,958
Stamford is closed!

717
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,194
Michael, we're not closed.

718
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:51,729
Stamford is closed!

719
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,730
Stamford is closed!
We did it?

720
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,631
We did it!
We did it!

721
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,467
We did it!

722
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,368
Yaaahhhh!
We did it!

723
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,438
We did it!
Yeah!

724
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,906
We did it!

725
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,308
Yeah!
Right here, right here.

726
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,177
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

727
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,079
Ho, ho, ho, ho, hoooo!

728
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,180
Yeah, baby!

729
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,750
In your face!

730
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:13,751
We did it.

731
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,152
Oh, man.

732
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,588
How did we do it?

733
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,722
I don't know.
I have no idea.

734
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,791
I don't understand.

735
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,293
Well, for a minute there,
I saw myself

736
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,195
selling my house,
moving to Costa Rica,

737
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,231
learning how to surf.

738
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,800
But Costa Rica
will still be there...

739
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,571
...when I'm 65.
