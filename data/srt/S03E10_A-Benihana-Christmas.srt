1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,938
Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,541
Why are you...
why did you bring that here?

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,909
Don't worry.
She's dead.

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,578
Oh, wait...

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,679
He's dead.

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,382
Dwight, what... uhh!

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,716
I accidentally ran over it.

8
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:18,984
It's a Christmas miracle.

9
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:19,985
Well, get it out of here.

10
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,054
Relax, okay?

11
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:23,222
And because this is Christmas,

12
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,690
I am going to roast this goose

13
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,893
and prepare it with
a wild rice dressing.

14
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,929
Do we have any cayenne pepper
in the kitchen?

15
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,731
Merry Christmas, Dwight.

16
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:33,732
Jim.

17
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,134
Wow.
What have we got here?

18
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,168
What does it look like?

19
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,803
Dead goose.

20
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,171
And circle gets the square.

21
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,539
All right.

22
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,774
So can you watch this?

23
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:42,775
I'm gonna get my carving knife

24
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,076
out of the trunk.

25
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,444
Ah, Dwight,
we talked about this.

26
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,379
No, Toby, this is different.

27
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,714
He is already dead.

28
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,884
Once, I brought in a duck
to prepare for lunch.

29
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,752
And people got upset.

30
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,022
Apparently, they
got attached to the duck

31
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,557
and didn't want
to see it killed.

32
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,892
He was already dead.

33
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,094
And we Schrutes use
every part of the goose.

34
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:05,664
The meat has a delicious,
smoky, rich flavor.

35
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,399
Plus, you can use
the molten goose grease

36
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,767
and save it in the refrigerator.

37
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:09,835
Thus saving you
a trip to the store

38
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,470
for a can
of expensive goose grease.

39
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,539
Wow, win-win.

40
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,741
Exactly.
Thank you, Jim.

41
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,076
I like goose.
And it's already dead.

42
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,377
Is it so crazy if we eat it?

43
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,079
That is crazy.
It's crazy.

44
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,247
Dwight, you cannot
keep that here.

45
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,816
Okay, that is ridiculous.

46
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:26,018
And totally against
the spirit of Christmas.

47
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,486
Come on, Dwight.

48
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:31,323
We went over this, like,
for a half an hour.

49
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,991
It's Christmas, Toby.

50
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:36,095
It's a dead animal
in our office, you can't...

51
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,362
Toby...

52
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,397
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,066
Please?

54
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,634
Please?

55
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,241
Clean it in your car.

56
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,243
I would like it off my desk.

57
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,645
Oh, Pam.
Take a chill pill.

58
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,555
Ah!

59
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,157
Hey!

60
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,892
I would like

61
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,593
a nice slice

62
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,562
of Christmas Pam.

63
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,130
Side of candy Pams.

64
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,865
And perhaps...

65
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,234
some Pam chops.

66
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,802
- Can I help you, Michael?
- With mint.

67
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,438
I'm looking for
the toy drive box.

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,439
It's behind you.

69
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,874
Okay.

70
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,477
Well, I need to put
this bike in there.

71
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,511
I hope it'll fit

72
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,880
with all these little
knickknacks.

73
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,349
Wow.
What kind of bike is that?

74
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,085
Um, I don't know.
Average kind.

75
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,921
The tires look pretty worn.

76
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,590
Well, that is probably
from the test drive.

77
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:12,891
But the paint's chipping.

78
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,760
Is that your old bike, Michael?

79
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,461
No.

80
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,729
Yo, Michael.
Sweet ride, Mike.

81
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,797
Oh, thanks.

82
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,401
Michael...

83
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,669
Yes?

84
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,871
Oh, Pam.

85
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,506
That is so sweet.

86
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,874
You didn't have to do that.

87
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,042
I didn't.
It's from corporate.

88
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,677
Okay.

89
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,844
Did everybody get one of these?

90
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,046
- Yep.
- Terrific.

91
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,347
Good.

92
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,849
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

93
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,619
My girlfriend Carol
is coming to our party tonight.

94
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,488
And I have a little
surprise for her.

95
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,600
Um, taking her to Sandals,
Jamaica.

96
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,301
All-inclusive.

97
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,636
All-inclusive.

98
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,605
You know what that means.

99
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,073
Right?

100
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,307
Yeah.

101
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,618
Oh, I think you're supposed
to put a toy in the box, Creed.

102
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,319
And a happy holiday to you.

103
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,760
Carol.

104
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,462
Hi, is Michael around here?

105
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,696
There she is!

106
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,331
A Christmas Carol.

107
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,532
Hello.

108
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,336
You're about five hours
early to the party.

109
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,306
Oh, you're such a blonde.

110
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,607
- Michael...
- Hey, everybody!

111
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,810
I don't know who you
haven't met yet,

112
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,479
but I think this is one of them.

113
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,781
This is my girlfriend, Carol.

114
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,316
This is just the front of her.

115
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,318
Show 'em...
show 'em the other side.

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,853
- What?
- Turn around.

117
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,621
Turn around.
Come on.

118
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,123
Get out of here.

119
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,591
Oh, you get out of here.

120
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,592
- Michael...
- Yes?

121
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,826
If I may say,

122
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,595
she's even prettier
than you described her.

123
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,163
Oh, ouch!

124
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,299
Michael, I don't think
there's anything wrong

125
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,000
with the way you described her.

126
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,101
Thank you.

127
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,503
I really need a moment
alone with you.

128
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,506
Not as much as I need
a moment alone with you.

129
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,740
Brrp!

130
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,478
What is this?

131
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,847
That is my Christmas card.

132
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,417
It's a picture of you and me
and your kids on a ski trip,

133
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,584
having a blast.

134
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,019
"Ski-son's Greetings."

135
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:24,323
No, see, we never
went on a ski trip.

136
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,424
I know, I know.

137
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,892
- I went on a ski trip...
- Right.

138
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,328
Two years ago, with my kids
and my ex-husband.

139
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,730
Yes, but what you didn't
realize at the time

140
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,533
was that I was with you,
in a sense.

141
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,301
- I was in your heart.
- Michael...

142
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,803
And next to your kids.
What?

143
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:40,339
This is so weird.

144
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,973
I don't understand.

145
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,242
It's a bold move
to Photoshop yourself

146
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,745
into a picture with your
girlfriend and her kids

147
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,147
on a ski trip
with their real father.

148
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,150
But then again,
Michael's a bold guy.

149
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,919
Is bold the right word?

150
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,654
I think you're
a really sweet guy.

151
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,788
Okay.

152
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,956
But, um...

153
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,558
I don't know how to deal with...

154
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,461
with, like this... thing.

155
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,563
And... and the proposal.

156
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,032
And I don't think things
are gonna work out with us.

157
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,200
No, no, no, no.
Okay, okay.

158
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,268
You know what?
You're not thinking straight.

159
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,370
You know what you need?

160
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,438
You need...

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,873
to think this through in...

162
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,845
Jamaica's largest
freshwater pool.

163
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,047
What are you talking about?

164
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,049
I got us tickets...

165
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,318
to Sandals, Jamaica.

166
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,486
We leave day after tomorrow.

167
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,887
You had better find

168
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,823
the skimpiest bikini there is.

169
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,858
Michael...

170
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,292
And it's all-inclusive.

171
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,628
Michael...
Yes?

172
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,196
I'm sorry.

173
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,266
No, Carol.

174
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,834
You walk out that door,
and it is over.

175
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,736
I know.

176
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:52,844
Psst!

177
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,212
Jim.

178
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,587
Um, hey.

179
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,722
Hey.

180
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,424
I need to give you
your Christmas gift now.

181
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,159
Because, um...

182
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,527
Well, I'll just tell you.

183
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,095
What?

184
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,197
For the past few months,

185
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,668
I've been sending Dwight
letters from the CIA.

186
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,172
Are you serious?

187
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,808
They're considering him
for a top-secret mission.

188
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,342
There's his application.

189
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,911
And this is where
I made him list

190
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:29,114
every secret he promised
he'd never, ever tell.

191
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,517
"Last year, my boss,
Michael Scott,

192
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,820
"took a day off, 'cause
he said he had pneumonia,

193
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,221
"but really,
he was leaving early

194
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,789
to go to magic camp."

195
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,858
Wow.

196
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,059
So here's the gift.

197
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,229
You get to decide
what his top secret mission is.

198
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,231
Sorry I didn't wrap it.

199
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,937
You know what?
Um...

200
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,305
I really don't think

201
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,307
I should be doing this stuff
anymore, though.

202
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,642
Oh.

203
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,144
No, just 'cause
of the promotion.

204
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,879
Oh, yeah. Just feels a
little bit like, uh...

205
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:01,947
No, I get it.

206
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,715
Of course.

207
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,217
Okay.

208
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,318
Oh.

209
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,296
I feel like there's a chance
for me to start over.

210
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,165
And... if I fall back

211
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,502
into the same kind of things
I used to do, then...

212
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,237
what am I doing?

213
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,944
I'd like everybody's attention.

214
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,413
Christmas is canceled.

215
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,948
You can't cancel a holiday.

216
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,984
Keep it up, Stanley,
and you will lose New Year's.

217
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,118
What does that mean?

218
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,386
Jim, take New Year's
away from Stanley!

219
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,420
Michael,

220
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,488
what's going on?

221
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,195
Carol and I...

222
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,831
split up.

223
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,499
Amicably.

224
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,368
And I just don't think
it would be appropriate

225
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,904
to celebrate
under the circumst...

226
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,338
Will they still air Rudolph?

227
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,474
That's not fair.

228
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,875
Are we going to cancel
Hanukkah as well?

229
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,678
Fine!

230
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,380
Have your party!

231
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,582
Just no guests.

232
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,584
But we invited guests.

233
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,253
Well, you know what, Phyllis?

234
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,555
All of your guests

235
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,390
would have probably canceled

236
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,125
at the last minute anyway.

237
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,359
Leaving your life

238
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,162
a stupid, rotten mess.

239
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,398
Okay.

240
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,307
It hurts.

241
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,108
I know.

242
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,544
It hurts my heart.

243
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,647
It hurts my stomach.

244
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,849
Hurts my arms.

245
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,419
Okay, well, why are you
laying like that?

246
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,688
Thanks.

247
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,957
How did you push away
the bad thoughts?

248
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,291
Like what?

249
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,962
Like maybe
the real reason they left

250
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:00,298
was because...
there were things

251
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,801
they wanted you to do

252
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,836
in bed... that were...

253
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,739
- Wha... um...
- ...foreign and scary.

254
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,474
I... I don't believe...

255
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,443
And not that you didn't
wanna try them.

256
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,612
Some wine might have helped.

257
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,380
Do you know
what I'm referring to?

258
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,982
I don't need to know.

259
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,383
Michael...
Yep?

260
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,584
Sorry to interrupt.

261
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,087
It appears we're
one bathrobe short.

262
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,655
Take it from Toby.

263
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,991
Copy.

264
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,627
Pam, would you like to go
to Sandals, Jamaica with me?

265
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,661
No, thank you.

266
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:30,729
It's all... okay.

267
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,466
Hey, Dwight.

268
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,636
Some pretty nice robes there.

269
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,871
Why?

270
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,073
Phyllis, I need you
to pick up green streamers

271
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,875
at lunch.

272
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,210
I thought you said
green was whorish.

273
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:48,613
No, orange is whorish.

274
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,851
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas

275
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,920
to make the Stamford people
feel more at home.

276
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,123
Each year,
we have a Christmas raffle.

277
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,225
Cool. It would never work here.

278
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,661
Okay.

279
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,664
Um, another idea was...
karaoke.

280
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,565
No.

281
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,733
A Christmas drinking game.

282
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:09,734
Yes.

283
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,736
God help you.

284
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:12,771
What?

285
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,573
These are all terrible ideas.

286
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,108
And none of them
are on the theme

287
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,377
of a Nutcracker Christmas.

288
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,212
I think you should leave.

289
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,415
You're kidding.

290
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,783
You tried this out.

291
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,885
And it's clearly not for you.

292
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,386
It's time to go.

293
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,791
Come on.

294
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,659
Please?
Thank you.

295
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,296
Okay.
Thank you very much.

296
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,942
What are you doing?

297
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,477
We are getting rid of everything

298
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,479
that reminds you of Carol.

299
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,682
Hey, what's a-haps?

300
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,217
Carol?

301
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,618
No.

302
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,887
Oh, look at this.

303
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,557
Your old condo closing papers.

304
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,292
Ew, it's riddled
with Carol's name.

305
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,894
I wish I could
throw this in the box.

306
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:21,206
Why don't you just
buy the whole song?

307
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,742
I don't have to buy it.

308
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,910
I just wanna taste it.

309
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,479
That's all.

310
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,882
I just want
a little taste of it.

311
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,317
Oh, look at this.

312
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,085
She saved you $2,000

313
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:38,323
'cause they failed to report
a mold problem.

314
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,225
But wouldn't that
affect the final...

315
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,426
How did she...

316
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,895
Oh... oh, I see
what she did.

317
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,765
That is good.
Wow.

318
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,267
That Carol is one smart cookie.

319
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,253
This is an old adage,

320
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,422
but they say that when
you find true love,

321
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,459
you know within
the first 24 hours.

322
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,128
With Carol,

323
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,165
I knew within
the first 24 minutes

324
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,834
of the second day I met her.

325
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,647
I feel like I've been
kind of cold to Karen.

326
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,448
And there's
no real reason for it.

327
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,485
I mean, it's not like she's ever
done anything to me.

328
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,755
So... I think I probably
shouldn't be cold to her.

329
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,891
Hey... Karen...
um...

330
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:47,992
Sorry about that meeting today.

331
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,494
That was really crazy.

332
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,563
Yeah, right?
I'm so glad you said that.

333
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,098
Because I don't know how
those meetings usually go.

334
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,967
Um, usually like that.

335
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,836
Does anyone ever
stand up to Angela?

336
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,571
I think one of her cats
did once.

337
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,773
She came in with scratches
all over her face.

338
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,008
Right.

339
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,145
Um... I really liked
your karaoke idea.

340
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,179
Oh, cool, yeah.

341
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,314
That could really be fun.

342
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,582
You guys do a raffle?

343
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,850
Yeah, we do a raffle.

344
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,488
Hey, Kev.

345
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,656
Hey.

346
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,271
This should have
been up yesterday.

347
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,839
It'll be all right.

348
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,143
What is that?

349
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,812
"The Committee to Plan Parties

350
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,214
invites you to
a Margarita-Karaoke Christmas."

351
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,383
There's no such thing as
the Committee to Plan Parties.

352
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,252
There is now.
We just started it.

353
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,220
Well, you can't just
start a committee.

354
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,622
You have to have funding.

355
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:51,656
What's your funding?

356
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,724
$200.

357
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,791
What's ours again?

358
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,826
Um, $201.

359
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:55,827
Right.

360
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:56,895
Hey!

361
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,696
A Margarita-Karaoke
Christmas party.

362
00:14:58,698 --> 00:14:59,797
That sounds like fun.

363
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,232
No, that is not a party.

364
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,500
There's only one party,

365
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,068
and it's hosted by the party
planning committee,

366
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,704
and it starts at 3:00.

367
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,972
Then why are there two flyers?

368
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,074
I understand that this
is confusing for everyone.

369
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,342
Let me explain.

370
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,177
There's a party
that starts at 3:00.

371
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,512
Right.

372
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,747
And then there's
a way more fun party

373
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,848
that starts at 2:45.

374
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,516
Right, and if you're interested

375
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,817
in the way more fun party,

376
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,219
all the info can be found here

377
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,821
on our more
brightly-colored flyer.

378
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,696
I didn't see where it was.

379
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,199
Yep, looks like
the Scranton people

380
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,467
and the Stamford people

381
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,436
are finally coming together.

382
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,538
And that's what you want, right?

383
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,208
I think that's a really good...

384
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,177
Pam and Karen, I am ordering you

385
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,180
to cease and desist all party
planning immediately.

386
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,982
You can't do that.

387
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,216
As ranking number three
in this office...

388
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,985
Um, eh...
I'm number three.

389
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,053
You're number four.

390
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,421
- Yeah, but I'm number three.
- Uh, no.

391
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,790
You must turn over to me
all Christmas decorations

392
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,058
and party paraphernalia
immediately

393
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,626
that will be returned to you
on January 4th.

394
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,361
Okay, I think I can help here.

395
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,529
Okay, good.

396
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,264
As ranking number two,
I am starting a committee

397
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,433
to determine the validity
of the two committees.

398
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,934
And I am the sole member.

399
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,469
The committee will act
on this now.

400
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,670
Okay, this is stupid.

401
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,138
Could you please keep it down?
I'm in session.

402
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,776
I've determined
this committee is valid.

403
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:19,811
What? No, no!

404
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,979
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

405
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,847
Permission to join
the validity committee.

406
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,985
Permission denied.

407
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,286
Damn it!

408
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,590
Hey.

409
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,126
I can't concentrate when
I know you're in pain, man.

410
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,828
Let me take you to lunch.

411
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,665
Come on, my treat.

412
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,400
All right.

413
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,836
Nothing here to distract
myself with anyway.

414
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,504
That's my boy.

415
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,306
I know the perfect place too.

416
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,340
Hooters?

417
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,509
No, Benihana.

418
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,311
Much classier.

419
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,113
But don't worry.

420
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,315
The babes are totally hot too.

421
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,185
Well, I need my entourage.

422
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,754
Jim, Dwight, Ryan.

423
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,355
Come on, we're going
to Asian Hooters.

424
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,823
Oh, man, I can't.

425
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,692
- Why not?
- I'm not feeling so well.

426
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,926
I got a ton of work to do here.

427
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,495
MSG allergy, peanut allergy.

428
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,863
I just ate there last night.

429
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,399
Okay.
Feel better.

430
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,466
Thanks.

431
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,667
Come on, Jim.
Let's go.

432
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,302
Okay.

433
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,738
Wow... thanks for taking
all the excuses, dude.

434
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
Doctor appointment,
car trouble, plantar warts,

435
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,275
granddad fought in WWII.

436
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,977
Use your head, man.
I keep mine in here.

437
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:29,147
Look alive, Halpert.
Welcome back.

438
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,182
Bros before hoes!
Why?

439
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,418
Because your bros
are always there for you.

440
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,153
They have got your back

441
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,255
after your ho
rips your heart out

442
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,790
for no good reason.

443
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,626
And you were nothing
but great to your ho,

444
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,395
and you told her that she was
the only ho for you,

445
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,899
and that she was better than all
the other hoes in the world.

446
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,700
And then...

447
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,973
then suddenly,
she's not your ho no mo'.

448
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,281
So...
she looks really hot.

449
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,715
So I said,

450
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,818
"You look hotter
than usual today."

451
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,419
Thank you.

452
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,655
Michael.

453
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,523
Head of the table.

454
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,392
Just get in right there.
Good.

455
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,694
Jim.

456
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,196
Actually, um...

457
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,098
Excuse me, sir, I'm gonna
need to take this chair.

458
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,365
- Dwight, just leave them...
- So...

459
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,366
Leave them alone.

460
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,001
Please.
They're on a date.

461
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,703
They look very happy.

462
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,606
So she looks at me, right?

463
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:33,344
And she goes, "I'm sorry,
do I even know you?"

464
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,612
After a year.

465
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,214
A year of buying
lattes from her.

466
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,849
- Do you believe that?
- Yes.

467
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:38,983
I can't, uh,

468
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,618
I can't hear what you're saying!

469
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,286
Carol used to drink lattes.

470
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,354
Who are you talking about?

471
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,690
She would get this little
foam mustache.

472
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,024
Carol had a mustache?

473
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,060
And I used to say,
"Hey, got latte?"

474
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,095
And she'd say,
"That's not funny."

475
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,196
What are you guys talking about?

476
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,397
She totally got me.

477
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,600
She understood...

478
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:58,069
that we didn't have to laugh

479
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,971
- Michael!
- to enjoy each other.

480
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,339
Repeat what you said, louder.

481
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,941
It is my job
to be there for Michael.

482
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,943
How can I be there for Michael

483
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,578
if I'm here for Michael?

484
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,619
I'm already starting to forget
what color eyes she had.

485
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,388
I can't... okay.
I'm gonna call her.

486
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,457
- I am going to call and find out...
- No!

487
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,525
Who are you calling?

488
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,393
- Put it away.
- I'm gonna call her.

489
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,962
Put that away.
SOS... we... hi.

490
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,531
Mayday.

491
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,433
Man down over here.
We need your help.

492
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,935
What can I get for ya?

493
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:35,273
I think we'll start with
a round of Nog-a-sakes.

494
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,543
One part eggnog.
Three parts sake!

495
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,711
Some places won't
make it for you, though,

496
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,347
because eggnog is seasonal.

497
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,052
You should put out salt
for the rims.

498
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,121
That's a great idea.

499
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,722
Phyllis?

500
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,158
I was just getting a snack.

501
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,893
You can have your snack in here.

502
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,562
Pam, don't tell her what to do.

503
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,563
Phyllis...

504
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,298
Oh... okay.

505
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,939
I think I'll go
to Angela's party

506
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,441
because that's the party I know.

507
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,977
I miss the days when
there was only one party

508
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,545
I didn't want to go to.

509
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,748
So I only use three?

510
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,117
If you're using more
than three pieces of tape

511
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,186
to wrap a present,
you're doing it wrong.

512
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,422
Okay, and where'd you get
all those cool bows?

513
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:27,491
Oh, I just get those
at any party supply place.

514
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,194
Okay.

515
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,696
Are you sure I can't use, like,

516
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,264
the cartoons from the newspaper?

517
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,600
Oh, yeah, your mom
would love that.

518
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,337
Hey.
Hey.

519
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,239
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

520
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,107
Bye.

521
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,842
He's cute.

522
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,077
You should date him.

523
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,378
Oh...

524
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,146
Yeah, maybe.

525
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,518
Looks like you got

526
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,221
a little nakiri
knife action going there.

527
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,623
No, it's usuba.

528
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,659
Yeah, I bet you wish
you had a nakiri, though.

529
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,828
Actually, the usuba's
the better knife

530
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,696
when you're working
with this quantity.

531
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,531
Eh, I don't know.

532
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,200
Still think nakiri's better.

533
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,769
I think he'd know.

534
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,108
Nothing he's doing
is cheering me up.

535
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,777
Wait for the onion.
Trust me.

536
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,016
Hey, Cindy.

537
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,317
He just had his heart broken.

538
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,718
You wouldn't do that
to him, would you?

539
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,953
I don't know.

540
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,321
Oh, sure you would.
Look at you.

541
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:33,057
I bet you break up
with a guy every hour.

542
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,327
You made her laugh!

543
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,929
Yes!
She totally digs us.

544
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,998
Watch, watch.

545
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,769
Huh? Huh?

546
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,138
What did I tell you?

547
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,773
You're right.
That's good.

548
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,212
Hello, everyone.

549
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,114
We would just like to announce

550
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,282
that our party is starting now

551
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,184
in the break room, so...

552
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,252
I have a very important

553
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:03,321
announcement to make.

554
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,156
About...

555
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,624
your paychecks.

556
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:09,427
Um... your paychecks
will be arriving

557
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:12,763
as scheduled on Friday.

558
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,865
And they will be
in the correct amount

559
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,267
that they normally are in.

560
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,306
Please stand by for a very
important announcement

561
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,874
further regarding your paycheck!

562
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,113
I need to know
if I can start the party.

563
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,683
Michael!

564
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,085
Hey!

565
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,152
Over here, Michael!

566
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,292
I don't know.
No one can hear me.

567
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:43,394
You know what?
Start the party.

568
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,629
Did Michael give you permission
to do this?

569
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,166
Start the party.

570
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,371
Also, I would like to inform you

571
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,805
that, um,

572
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:57,541
as a special treat,
my party will be starting early.

573
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,943
In fact, it will be starting...

574
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,444
right now.

575
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:03,347
- Our party is also starting now.
- Yep.

576
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,341
- All right, Stanley.
- Good choice.

577
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,542
Woo!

578
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,515
Welcome, Hannah.
You will not be disappointed.

579
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:38,916
Why would I be disappointed?

580
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,217
I said you wouldn't
be disappointed.

581
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,223
Meredith, if you don't
come to my party,

582
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,993
you will be very, very sorry.

583
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,861
Is that a threat?

584
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,597
No, it's an invitation.

585
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,366
- We have vodka!
- Lots of it.

586
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,742
I hear Angela's party will
have double fudge brownies.

587
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,077
But it will also have Angela.

588
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,482
So, double fudge.
Angela.

589
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:16,787
Double fudge... Angela.

590
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,691
Hmm...

591
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,528
Brownies.

592
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,263
Cupcakes.

593
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,565
Don't push it.

594
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,211
Are we taking this too far?
You know what?

595
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:43,447
I don't think we're
taking this far enough.

596
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,282
What?

597
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,585
I got goose bumps.

598
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,721
I don't back down.

599
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,090
My sister and I used to be
best friends,

600
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,359
and we haven't talked
in 16 years

601
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,962
over some disagreement
I don't even remember.

602
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:02,733
So... yeah,
I'm pretty good.

603
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,271
Oh!
Damn, this chicken is good.

604
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:10,007
My compliments to the chef.

605
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,509
Which is you!

606
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,810
Right?

607
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,613
Awesome!

608
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:17,081
I need some meat.

609
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,049
I want some steak.

610
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,552
That guy's got steak.

611
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,889
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

612
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,024
En garde!

613
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,693
It's family style.

614
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,161
No, it's not.

615
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,030
Oh, God.
Cindy!

616
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,431
- Cindy!
- I love steak.

617
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,967
I love it!

618
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,670
I want you to close your eyes

619
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,072
and imagine your dream house.

620
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,643
Come on!

621
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:48,879
Do it for Michael.
He's had a really long day.

622
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,180
What are you doing?

623
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,682
This is great.

624
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,450
Jim! Jim!

625
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,856
What... what's happening?

626
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,892
Oh, she's asleep.

627
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,061
Oh, narcolepsy.

628
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,396
Probably.

629
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,965
Okay, now open your eyes

630
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,434
and describe it to me.

631
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:13,070
I don't know.

632
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,005
It has four bedrooms and a loft.

633
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,974
- Oh, my God. Now she's up.
- Yeah?

634
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,242
And she's trying to describe

635
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,144
how to correctly
butcher a goose,

636
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,979
but she's having trouble
coming up with it.

637
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,547
Okay.
Cindy!

638
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,115
Yo, Cindy, Cindy.

639
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,184
Hold its neck back,

640
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,019
insert the knife
beneath the jaw,

641
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,821
bring it all the way around.

642
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,923
There's gonna be
a good amount of blood.

643
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,225
Have a bucket there
for the blood

644
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,428
and the innards
and the feathers.

645
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,564
Oh, no, this is different.

646
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,900
The CIA thing, that was
a prank on Dwight.

647
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:47,004
This is more like a, um...

648
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,672
Okay, it's pretty much
the same thing.

649
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:04,955
What do you think?

650
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,590
Fruity and delicious.

651
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,225
See, I told you.
You want one, Meredith?

652
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,462
No thanks.
They're too sweet.

653
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,897
Hey, so what's the status?

654
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,299
Looks like they forgot
the power cord.

655
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,867
- What?
- Oh, you're kidding me.

656
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,003
- No.
- Oh, God.

657
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,004
You guys, guys.

658
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,605
I'm sorry,

659
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,407
but there's a problem
with the karaoke machine.

660
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,843
Well, that blows.

661
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,711
Hang on, little ladies.
You don't need this thing.

662
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,780
I'll go grab my synthesizer.

663
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,451
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

664
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,787
Darryl! Darryl!

665
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,524
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

666
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,960
- Hi.
- Hey.

667
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,729
Hey, look when you get done
with your... meeting

668
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:46,797
you should come
to the break room.

669
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,831
We're having a party.

670
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,501
- Oh, okay.
- All right? See you later.

671
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,475
These nuts are really
hard to crack.

672
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,511
Try harder then.

673
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:09,186
Uh-uh, no one has seconds
until everyone's had some.

674
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,954
You've got to be kidding.

675
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,190
You've got to be kidding.

676
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,566
Cold, huh?

677
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:23,767
Yeah.

678
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,169
That'll help.

679
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,040
Is it cold in there?

680
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:34,011
They have been checking us
out all night.

681
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,479
I am not kidding!

682
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:38,248
We should invite them
to the Christmas party.

683
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,551
Now you are thinking.
Yes!

684
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,219
And you know what?

685
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,388
Because you have had
such a rough day,

686
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,190
you get Cindy.

687
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:50,060
Oh, you are such
a mensch, my friend.

688
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,868
Okay, where is everybody?

689
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,205
I would like them to meet
my new girlfriend.

690
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,440
I'm sure they'll want
to meet her too.

691
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,911
The least I could do

692
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,415
was give some poor
sick kid a bike.

693
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,583
That rocks.

694
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,551
Yeah, you rock.

695
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,353
Tell you what.
If you want it, it's yours.

696
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,021
Thanks!

697
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,326
I want to give you something.

698
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,862
Oh.

699
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,866
That's what she said?

700
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,234
Hello!

701
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,735
I would like everybody to meet

702
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:32,970
my new girlfriend.

703
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,605
And my new girlfriend.

704
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,173
Where's Dwight?

705
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,941
Is he the hot one
or the giant baby?

706
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,943
The giant baby.

707
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,512
Wow, I am so sorry.

708
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:44,314
I had no idea
this party'd be so lame.

709
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,083
There's another party
in the break room.

710
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,417
Oh, party in the break room.

711
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,286
Let's go, let's go.
Thank God.

712
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,587
Let's go to the break room.

713
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,823
Hey, excuse me!
Waitress lady, hey!

714
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:53,957
Where do you think
you're going with that?

715
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,259
I thought I could have it.

716
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,327
You can't have it.

717
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,495
I don't walk into your house

718
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,863
and steal your
Hello Kitty backpack.

719
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:01,365
Ssshut it!

720
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,033
Come on, party.

721
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,835
Hey, it's Angela!

722
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,121
I just think that
there are two...

723
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,857
two specific kinds of
people in the world.

724
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:31,695
People who own houses
and people who own condos.

725
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,631
All right?

726
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,668
And my question to you

727
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,470
is do you agree?

728
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,072
Do I agree about what?

729
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,807
Do you agree about what?

730
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,212
Wow!

731
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,347
You're lucky
you're so darn cute.

732
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,282
What are you talking about? Huh?

733
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,617
What are you talking about?

734
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:18,041
Way to go, Kev.
Good work.

735
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,754
Did you have fun at Benihana's?

736
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,623
No, it was awful.

737
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,491
I couldn't hear anything.

738
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,330
I've had the worst day here.

739
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,374
Dwight, you won the raffle.

740
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,310
No way! Yeah!

741
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:54,511
Open it, open it!

742
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:00,384
- Do you like it?
- Walkie-talkies!

743
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,818
Can I talk to you a sec?

744
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,353
Yes!

745
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,957
Well, the Committee to Plan
Parties has served its purpose.

746
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:11,561
We're gonna disband
in the name of Christmas.

747
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,630
In the name of
Nutcracker Christmas.

748
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,570
Angela, we've been hearing
really great things

749
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,205
about your brownies.

750
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,241
And we were hoping
you'd consider

751
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:25,809
merging the two parties.

752
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,878
I'm not sure.

753
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,418
Does your karaoke machine
have Christmas songs?

754
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,320
Yeah, but we don't
have a power cord.

755
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:40,123
Oh, I may have
seen it somewhere.

756
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,597
Is it this one?

757
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,599
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

758
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,169
Thanks.

759
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,637
We'll go tell everyone.

760
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,706
Okay.

761
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:55,032
When you know, you just know.

762
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,433
Right?

763
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:57,434
Right.

764
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,269
Check her out.

765
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,438
My little gal over there?
Babe-a-lectible.

766
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,206
Which one is she?

767
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,513
It's one of those two.

768
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,714
You don't know?

769
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,115
Dude, you should know.

770
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,551
Yeah, well, it's been hard.

771
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,087
They're wearing
the exact same uniform.

772
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,289
And I've been drinking.

773
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,392
And you know how all...

774
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,261
waitresses look alike.

775
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,599
I honestly don't see
what the big deal is.

776
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,168
Stevie Wonder is married.

777
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,337
Are you going to tell me
that Steve Wonder

778
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,174
doesn't love his wife just
because he's not sure

779
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,408
what she looks like?

780
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,177
Hey!

781
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,180
Where's my girl?

782
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:46,216
Is she in the fridge?

783
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:48,585
Where is she hiding?

784
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,489
I don't know where she is.

785
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,257
Oh, 'cause I'm drunk.

786
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,827
I can't even find her.
Argh-argh!

787
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,197
You know where I am.
I do!

788
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,965
Hi!

789
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,234
I just haven't
hugged you in a while.

790
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,336
Mmm!

791
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:07,637
Good.
That felt good.

792
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,706
Let's go party.

793
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:38,502
Monkey, this is Possum.
Do you copy?

794
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,303
Copy, Possum.
What's your 20?

795
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,140
No way!

796
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,809
What a horrible,
horrible movie that was.

797
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,577
And now I get to
remember it forever.

798
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,081
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

799
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,587
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey you!

800
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,623
How are you?

801
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,659
This party blows,
so we're gonna leave.

802
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,194
No, no, no.

803
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:07,097
Hey, you should stay
because we're having fun.

804
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,900
And... where do you
want to go?

805
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:11,935
I... we're just gonna
take off.

806
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:15,605
You know what?
I... okay, listen.

807
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,040
I like you.

808
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,708
I really like you.

809
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,044
So much, in fact, that

810
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,213
I would like you to accompany me

811
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:27,250
on a trip to Sandals Jamaica.

812
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:30,620
No, I have school.

813
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,597
You want help?
Okay.

814
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,265
Merry Christmas!

815
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,334
Merry Christmas.

816
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,694
That waitress was the one.

817
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:13,163
No, she wasn't.

818
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:15,031
How can you be sure?

819
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,433
Well, for starters,

820
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,667
I've known you as a couple

821
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,035
since the beginning
of the relationship,

822
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,571
which was approximately
three hours ago.

823
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,508
Don't make fun of me.
You're making fun of me.

824
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,244
Sorry.

825
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:34,317
I guess I didn't
know her very well.

826
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,256
I marked her arm.

827
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,790
You what?

828
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,595
I... I put a mark
on her arm.

829
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,035
So I could tell 'em apart.

830
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:55,505
I don't...
I know, I know.

831
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:59,342
I can't believe
I gave her my bike.

832
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:02,345
Yeah.

833
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:06,650
Why do I feel like crap?

834
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:10,086
You just had a rebound.

835
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,522
Had a rebound.

836
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,457
Yeah.

837
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,059
Which, don't get me wrong,

838
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:18,795
can be a really fun distraction.

839
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,898
But when it's over,

840
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,567
you're left thinking about
the girl you really like.

841
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,703
The one that broke your heart.

842
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,777
I totally rebounded.

843
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,345
Someone else shoots,

844
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,314
and I take the ball and I score.

845
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,049
Well, I guess I didn't
really score.

846
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:42,118
And I'm not sure who is
actually shooting,

847
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,287
but... whatever.

848
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,355
Doesn't matter.

849
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:47,390
It's all good.

850
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:48,892
Or as my ex might say,

851
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:55,432
"Domo arigato,
Mr. Scott-o."

852
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:25,862
Um, yes, I just wanted to see

853
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,866
if you would like to come
to Jamaica with me.

854
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,603
There's this resort
called Sandals.

855
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,175
Really?

856
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,711
Okay.
All right.

857
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,747
I promise you won't be
disappointed.

858
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,950
Um, it's all-inclusive.

859
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:53,289
Too soon.

860
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,881
- Night, Pam.
- Night.

861
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,684
Oh, you know what?

862
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,920
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

863
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,922
I intercepted
a transmission earlier,

864
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,725
and it seems that the CIA is
gonna need Dwight

865
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,794
down at their headquarters
at Langley for training

866
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:34,197
and an ice cream social
with the other agents.

867
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,001
We should get him a bus ticket.

868
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,235
To make his trip easier.

869
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,937
Oh, no, that would be
very patriotic.

870
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,641
It costs $75.

871
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:46,943
Hmm.

872
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,746
Well, maybe the CIA
could send a helicopter.

873
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:51,614
Oh!

874
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,089
What the...

875
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,061
"You have been compromised.

876
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,597
Abort mission.
Destroy phone."

877
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,166
Destroy phone.
