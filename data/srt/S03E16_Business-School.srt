1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,869
Oh, hey, Kevin.
Nice of you to join us.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,137
Where were you?

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,406
My tire blew out
on the way here, Michael.

4
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,707
Uh-huh.
I almost died.

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,075
I went into this skid...

6
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,910
Pop quiz.
What?

7
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,278
Why is today a special day?

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,813
I almost died.

9
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,181
Today is a special day

10
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,018
because I am being honored

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,389
as a visiting professor...

12
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,325
special lecturer emeritus...

13
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,960
How did you...
How did you put it?

14
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:29,261
You will be a guest speaker

15
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,996
in my Emerging Enterprises
class.

16
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:34,400
In business school, Kevin.

17
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,635
Business school.
Wow.

18
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,170
If you bring your boss to class,

19
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:41,540
it automatically bumps you up
a full letter grade.

20
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,075
So...

21
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:47,279
I'd be stupid
not to do it, right?

22
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,648
A boss is like a teacher.

23
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,351
And I am like the cool teacher.

24
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,119
Like Mr. Handell.

25
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,722
Mr. Handell would
hang out with us.

26
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,224
And he would tell us
awesome jokes.

27
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,994
And he actually hooked up
with one of the students.

28
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:05,397
Um, and then like 12 other
kids came forward.

29
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,233
It was in all the papers.

30
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,369
Really ruined eighth grade
for us.

31
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,760
Here we go.
College road show.

32
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,929
Gotta bring our A game.

33
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,497
What is the most inspiring thing

34
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,998
I ever said to you?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,535
"Don't be an idiot."
Changed my life.

36
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,771
Whenever I'm about
to do something, I think,

37
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,339
"Would an idiot do that?"

38
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,742
And if they would,
I do not do that thing.

39
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,612
Will they throw
their hats, you think?

40
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,980
What?

41
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,784
A lot times at a school
or naval academy,

42
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,386
after a rousing speech,
the crowd will throw its hats

43
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:02,554
high into the air.

44
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,356
You understand
nobody's graduating.

45
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,691
Yeah, I know, I know.

46
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,025
I'm just saying,
if they did throw their hats,

47
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,229
I've got a great line for that.

48
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:14,933
May your hats fly
as high as your dreams.

49
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,771
Thought it was
a pretty good line.

50
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,574
Just... it doesn't apply.

51
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,610
I understand.
Wow.

52
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,778
Relax, spazzy boy.

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,280
Sometimes you're such
a little spazz!

54
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,648
God, I'm driving!

55
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,517
Quit it!
We have fun.

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,653
I can't wait
for your art show tonight.

57
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,021
Okay, just so you know,

58
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,322
it's just the students
from my class

59
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,991
in a little studio.

60
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,092
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

61
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,460
Thanks.

62
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,096
I'm really happy
to be back with Roy.

63
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,032
I think it shows maturity.

64
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,569
Maturity and dignity.

65
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,970
Is that braggy?

66
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,406
I don't mean it to be braggy.

67
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,409
Love you.
You too.

68
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,679
Pam's with Roy.
I'm with Karen.

69
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,382
And Brangelina
is with Frangelina.

70
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:06,552
Moving on.

71
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,420
I can't believe you're
back together with Roy.

72
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,055
Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,257
We have such a solid
foundation, you know.

74
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,760
Oh, my God.
You're so in love now.

75
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:15,961
Yeah.

76
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,597
Oh, you should come
to my art show, by the way.

77
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,332
Oh, art show.

78
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,900
I mean, it's not a big deal.

79
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,235
But I think a lot of people

80
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,836
from the office
are gonna be there.

81
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,772
Oh, yeah.

82
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,775
Definitely I'll be there,
for sure.

83
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,345
Campus.

84
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,447
Brings back so many memories...

85
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,482
that I would've made.

86
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,651
Hey, Frisbee.
Check that out... oh!

87
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,887
What do you say we get
our Fris on

88
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,322
before class, huh?

89
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,427
Yeah! Woo!

90
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,497
Dude.

91
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,040
Oh, my God.

92
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,815
Animal stool.

93
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,061
Dwight, what are you doing?

94
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,264
Solving a mystery, if that's
quite all right with you.

95
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,641
Come to papa.

96
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,909
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

97
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,711
What we have here is a bird

98
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,581
that has been trapped in a vent.

99
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,583
Fortunately,
I have found it before...

100
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,385
Bat! Bat!

101
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,620
Bat! Bat!

102
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,455
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,391
Bat!

104
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,027
No, everyone remain calm!

105
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,730
There it goes!

106
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,198
Good-bye.

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,107
Okay, this is it.

108
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,443
Ryan is doing my intro
right now.

109
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,680
Dunder Mifflin can't compete
with the modern chains,

110
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:18,450
and management is unwilling
or unable to adapt.

111
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,718
Their customers are dying off...

112
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,088
I can't hear what he's saying,

113
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,157
but he looks like
he's really into it.

114
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,364
Aah!

115
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,966
We have a bat in the office.

116
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,870
The simple solution would be
to open a window.

117
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,839
If we had windows
that could open.

118
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,909
Poop is raining
from the ceilings.

119
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,077
Poop!

120
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,779
Okay, thanks.

121
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,615
Animal Control
will be here at 6:00.

122
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,351
At 6:00?

123
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,186
No, that is unacceptable.

124
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,154
Okay, Jim, you are
the number two in this office.

125
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,623
You need to step up
and show some leadership.

126
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,192
I'm sorry, what did you say?

127
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,593
So weird.

128
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,528
What?
What's so weird?

129
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,563
The bat.

130
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,597
I mean, I know
I felt it bite me.

131
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,032
But look, there's no mark.

132
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,168
I feel so...

133
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,237
tingly.

134
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,840
So strangely powerful.

135
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,111
Oh, well.

136
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,550
And now, without further ado,

137
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,720
I present the regional manager
of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton,

138
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,555
Michael Scott.

139
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,870
Hello, everyone.
I am Michael Scott.

140
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,538
Hello, I'm Brandon Hidalgo,

141
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,707
CEO of The Teaching Company...

142
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,677
And I'd like to start today

143
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,913
by inspiring you.

144
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,415
May I borrow

145
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,151
someone's textbook, please?

146
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,586
Thank you.

147
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,821
What have we here?

148
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,756
Ooh, economics.

149
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,260
Very, very interesting.

150
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,566
You cannot learn...

151
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,668
from books.

152
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,872
Replace these pages...

153
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,541
with life lessons.

154
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,910
And then...

155
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:29,314
you will have a book...

156
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,617
that is worth
its weight in gold.

157
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,320
I know these are expensive,

158
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,290
um, but the lesson is priceless.

159
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,092
Good.

160
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,828
All right, I think
you're inspired.

161
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,829
Shall we proceed?

162
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,765
There are four kinds
of business.

163
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,167
Tourism.

164
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,069
Food service.

165
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,671
Railroads.

166
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,606
And sales.

167
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,610
And hospitals/manufacturing.

168
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,011
And air travel.

169
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,051
This is your job, Halpert.

170
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,118
Ow!

171
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,920
What happened?

172
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,989
That bread on your desk?
I just picked it up.

173
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,024
It's white-hot.

174
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,726
But, Jim,

175
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,294
this garlic bread is cold.

176
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,497
What?

177
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,298
No.

178
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,535
It burned me.
I...

179
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,136
Bizarre.

180
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,343
One crisis at a time.

181
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,245
If a vampire bat
was in the U.S.,

182
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,548
it would make sense for it
to come to a "sylvania."

183
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,183
Like Penn-sylvania.

184
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:42,754
Now, that doesn't mean that Jim
is gonna become a vampire.

185
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,757
Only that he carries
the vampiric germ.

186
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,760
So... you want to start
a business?

187
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,262
How do you start?

188
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,463
What do you need?

189
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,232
Well, first of all,
you need a building.

190
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,303
And secondly, you need supply.

191
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,705
You need something to sell.

192
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,341
Now, this could be anything.

193
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,645
It could be a thingamajig

194
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,014
or a whosi-whatsi.

195
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,517
Or... a "Whatchamacallit."

196
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,556
Now, you need to sell those

197
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:22,527
in order to have
a "PayDay."

198
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,665
And if you sell enough of them,

199
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:31,603
you will make a "100 Grand."

200
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,640
Satisfied?

201
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,075
Oh, this looks great.

202
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,176
I'd love to be there,

203
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,546
but my daughter's play
is tonight.

204
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,949
Damn it.

205
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,317
You know,
one of the other parents

206
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,751
will probably videotape it.

207
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,387
Oh, no.
You should go.

208
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,158
Well, it's important
to support to local art.

209
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,827
And... and what they do
is not art.

210
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,031
Okay, I'm seeing some
confused faces out there.

211
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,866
Let me slow down a little bit.

212
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,635
Break this down.

213
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,403
Okay.

214
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,206
The more stickers you sell,
the more profit...

215
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,674
fancy word for money...

216
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,978
you have to buy PlayStations
and Beanie Babies.

217
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,379
Michael...

218
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,847
And products!
what we normally do here

219
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,315
is more of a question
and answer type thing.

220
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,316
Well, okay.

221
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,351
I was just kind of
getting going.

222
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:20,585
Yeah, I know.

223
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,653
Um, all right.

224
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,655
Okay, well, we can do questions.

225
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,390
Very good.
First hand up.

226
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:28,026
Sir, as a company that
primarily distributes paper,

227
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,128
how have you adapted
your business model

228
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,897
to function in an increasingly
paperless world?

229
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,501
We can't overestimate
the value of computers.

230
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,903
Yes, they are great
for playing games

231
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,439
and forwarding funny emails.

232
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:46,211
But real business
is done on paper, okay?

233
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,779
Write that down.

234
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,153
Hey, Jim, here's
the aspirin you wanted.

235
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,921
Oh, thank God.

236
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,790
I have such a headache
from that glare.

237
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,392
What glare?

238
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,293
The glare off Angela's crucifix.

239
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,296
It's blinding.

240
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,499
I don't have a lot
of experience with vampires,

241
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,200
but I have hunted werewolves.

242
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,136
I shot one once,

243
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,871
but by the time I got to it

244
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,840
it had turned back
into my neighbor's dog.

245
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,147
Extraordinary events

246
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,382
call for extraordinary actions.

247
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,085
We form an allegiance...
Sure.

248
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,954
To use sudden violence.
Okay.

249
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,589
Do you have the tools to turn

250
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,392
a wooden mop handle
into a stake?

251
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,729
What size?

252
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,097
What do you say to a customer

253
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,965
who wants to leave you
for the convenience

254
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,634
and savings
of a nationwide chain?

255
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,370
I say, "You will miss
our service.

256
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,239
And I absolutely guarantee
you'll come back."

257
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,774
Has anyone ever come back?

258
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,911
We don't want them back.
They're stupid.

259
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,846
How far has your
Herfindahl Index declined

260
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,847
since the merger?

261
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:56,981
Nice try.

262
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,183
How's your
Polack-says-what index?

263
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,184
What?

264
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,518
Thanks, Kowalski.

265
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,921
Can we get back on track here?

266
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,489
By your own employee's
calculation,

267
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,858
you'll be obsolete in the next
five to ten years.

268
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,762
Wait, Ryan said that?

269
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,507
What are you doing?

270
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,542
You better not hurt
that little bat.

271
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,578
Animals can't feel pain.

272
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,912
Don't hurt that bat, Creed!

273
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,748
It's a living thing
with feelings and a family.

274
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,583
Flush him towards the door.

275
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,752
On my go... now!

276
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,753
Bat!

277
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,920
Aah! Kill it!

278
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,590
Kill it! Kill it!

279
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,561
I...am a hero.

280
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,499
Yeah, sure, you know business.

281
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:48,900
Sitting up here

282
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,769
in your ivory tower.

283
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,971
And your ebony tower.

284
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,405
But you know what?

285
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,573
I'll tell you one thing.

286
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,842
Dunder Mifflin is here to stay.

287
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,978
But how can you compete
against a company

288
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,045
with the resources
of a nationwide chain?

289
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,848
David will always beat Goliath.

290
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,116
But there's five Goliaths.

291
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,818
There's Staples, OfficeMax...

292
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,919
Yeah, yeah.

293
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,588
You know what else
is facing five Goliaths?

294
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,557
America.

295
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,958
Al-Qaeda.

296
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,794
Global warming.

297
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,030
Sex predators.

298
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,533
Mercury poisoning.

299
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,934
So do we just give up?

300
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,370
Is that what we're learning
in business school?

301
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,371
But in the big picture...

302
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,473
Dunder Mifflin is
the big picture.

303
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,741
Can't you understand that?

304
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,209
No, you can't.

305
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,211
You're too young.

306
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:38,583
Ryan has never made a sale.

307
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,586
And he started a fire

308
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,222
trying to make a cheesy pita.

309
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,624
And everybody thinks
he's a tease.

310
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,526
Well, you know what?

311
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,963
He doesn't know anything,
and neither do you.

312
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,437
So suck on that!

313
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,560
It wasn't personal.

314
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:23,862
Business is always personal.

315
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,496
It's the most personal thing
in the world.

316
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,131
When we get back
to the office, pack your things.

317
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,433
Pack my...
You heard me.

318
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,268
Pack your things.

319
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,546
I really want to come out!

320
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,681
Good night, Mary Beth!

321
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:57,028
So... you're cool
to just wait here

322
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,563
for Animal Control?

323
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,331
Animal Control?

324
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,434
I've been controlling animals
since I was six.

325
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,937
Cool, okay.

326
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,007
I'm gonna go home and lie down.

327
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,341
Draw the shades.

328
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,810
There's just so much
sun in here.

329
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,851
Bye, Dwight.

330
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,322
Good-bye, Jim.

331
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,493
And good luck.

332
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,098
Jim is on a path now.

333
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,934
An eternal journey.

334
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,136
And I wish him well.

335
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,338
But I have a destiny
in this realm.

336
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,275
Specifically...
in the kitchen.

337
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,377
And it's all from
the same series.

338
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,612
Oh.

339
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,213
Called "Impressions."

340
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,848
Oh.

341
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,216
Not that I would call myself

342
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,052
an Impressionist, per se.

343
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,587
But maybe one day.

344
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,922
I hope so.

345
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,057
Hmm.

346
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,892
I still need, you know,

347
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,061
my breakthrough or whatever.

348
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,866
Hey, babe.
How are you?

349
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,134
Good.

350
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,970
Look who I brought.
My brother, huh?

351
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,738
Hey, Kenny.
Hey, Pam.

352
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,540
Hey.

353
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,775
How about this, huh?

354
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,910
I show up with my brother,

355
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,380
and no one from work is here.

356
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,815
That's pretty cool, huh?

357
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,857
Magic time.

358
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,734
My hair!
Aah, get off!

359
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,403
Get off me!
Get off me!

360
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,504
Get off me!

361
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,940
Hold still, woman!

362
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,442
Oh, my God, my God!

363
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,787
You're welcome.

364
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,127
It's cool if I go, right?

365
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,461
I mean, I looked at all of them.

366
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,631
Yeah, I'll just...
I'll drive myself home.

367
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,933
To my place?

368
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,936
Maybe.
I'm a little tired.

369
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,572
Your art was the prettiest art

370
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,141
of all the art.

371
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,677
Thank you.

372
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,480
Look...

373
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,615
I'm sorry, okay?

374
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,984
I was just trying
to do my presentation.

375
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,887
And of course
I was wrong to suggest

376
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,057
that Dunder Mifflin might
ever go out of business.

377
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,825
But you don't have to fire me.

378
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:45,229
Fire you?
No, no, no.

379
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,532
You are moving to the annex.

380
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,734
To the annex?

381
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,102
Where Kelly is?

382
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,437
A good manager
doesn't fire people.

383
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:57,141
He hires people
and inspires people.

384
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,043
People, Ryan.

385
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,714
And people will never
go out of business.

386
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,087
You're the one who said
we needed more culture.

387
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,188
This is culture to you?

388
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,656
It's her first try.

389
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,592
Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try,

390
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,860
he drew the hands
of the peasants.

391
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,662
Meaning what?

392
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,832
Meaning real art
takes courage, okay?

393
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,233
And... and honesty.

394
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,534
Well, those aren't
Pam's strong points.

395
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,236
Yeah, exactly.

396
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,305
That's why this is motel art.

397
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,845
Thanks for coming.

398
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,461
Pam-casso!
Sorry I'm late.

399
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,929
I had to race across town.

400
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,431
Oh, Michael.

401
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,567
Wow!

402
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,703
You did these freehand?

403
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,304
Yep.

404
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,773
My God, these could be tracings.

405
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,208
Oh!

406
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,677
Look at this one.

407
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,412
Wow!

408
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,114
You nailed it.

409
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,220
How much?

410
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,955
What do you mean?

411
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:21,292
I don't see a price.

412
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,729
Um, you want to buy it?

413
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:25,897
Well, yeah.

414
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,766
Yeah, we have to have it
for the office.

415
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,536
I mean, there's my window.

416
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,137
And there's my car!

417
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,805
Is that your car?

418
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,807
Uh-huh.

419
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,481
That is our building.

420
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,819
And we sell paper.

421
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,361
I am really proud of you.

422
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,207
Thank you.

423
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,875
What?

424
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,748
Do you have something
in your pocket?

425
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,718
A Chunky.

426
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,591
Do you want half?

427
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,192
No, thank you.

428
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,860
Okay.

429
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,364
It is a message.

430
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,032
It is an inspiration.

431
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:40,104
It is a source of beauty.

432
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,106
And without paper,

433
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,876
it could not have happened.

434
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,945
Unless you had a camera.

435
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,015
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

436
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,350
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

437
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,684
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

438
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,286
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

439
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,588
It's only temporary, okay?
Don't get excited.

440
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,424
I won't, I won't, I won't.

441
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,859
I won't.
I won't.

442
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,928
I won't, I won't, I won't,
I won't, I won't!
