1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,504
Can you confirm
that the straps are tight?

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,705
Yes.

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,941
But this one's a little...

4
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:12,444
And now the chains!

5
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,246
A lot of people think
that magic camp

6
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,714
is just for kids.

7
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:16,749
And that's why so many

8
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,250
other people
in my class were kids.

9
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,019
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

10
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,856
It's, um, really for anybody

11
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:27,393
with a dream,
and a belief in magic,

12
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,529
and a little extra time
after school.

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,533
Magic, magic, magic, magic...

14
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,802
And now, Michael the Magic

15
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:40,539
will attempt to escape
from extreme bondage.

16
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,541
Can he do it?

17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,176
I don't see how he can.

18
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,411
I know how.

19
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,446
He'd dislocate his shoulder
and slip his arm out.

20
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,548
No! No.

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,217
Everyone now count down with me.

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,252
Three!
Sorry.

23
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,486
Sorry, quickly.

24
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,655
So is it true
that if you can't get out,

25
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,357
you don't want anyone
to help you?

26
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,358
I will get out.

27
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,760
Oh, yes, I will.

28
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,029
So we shouldn't help you,
no matter how much

29
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,130
you might beg and plead.

30
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,698
No, all right, just...
this is getting hot.

31
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,467
So let's just do this,
okay, ready?

32
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,601
Three!

33
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,736
Two.

34
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:11,737
One!

35
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,172
Go!

36
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,563
Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,266
Aah!

38
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,035
Is everything okay, Michael?

39
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,404
Yes.

40
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:50,375
I cannot tell you
how I plan to escape.

41
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,878
Other than by using magic.

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,781
That is the magician's code.

43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,017
Help.

44
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,719
Separately,
on an unrelated note,

45
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:05,224
if you happen to find
a small brass key...

46
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,847
All right, ready?

47
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,617
Come on, guys,
early worm gets the worm.

48
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,185
Another worm?

49
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,253
Like, are they friends?

50
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,587
It's early bird gets the worm.

51
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,588
Okay.

52
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,658
Pam, would you smell my breath?

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,726
No. No.

54
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,728
Let me smell.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,566
Good, not great.

56
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,667
Michael, you go to parties
all the time.

57
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,269
Why is tonight so special?

58
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:54,139
Well, tonight is so special
because my boss's boss's boss,

59
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,242
the CFO, not his initials,
common mistake,

60
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,645
is having a little shindig
for all the managers

61
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,781
in the company, and Jan and I
are going as a couple.

62
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,616
For the first time.

63
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,685
So it's kind of
our coming out party.

64
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,853
Really.

65
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,556
And that is why tonight
is so special.

66
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,191
Jimbo, last chance carpool.

67
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,692
Oh, no thanks, I think
Karen and I'll take my car.

68
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,960
Sure? Might be a good idea.

69
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,862
If we all went together
we could save some gas.

70
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,297
Have fun. Long trip!
Thanks.

71
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,565
Play some games?
Oh.

72
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,533
Um... no, we're good.

73
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,734
I Spy.
Yeah.

74
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,070
Why don't I wanna go?

75
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,572
Didn't expect to need a reason,

76
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:27,573
so let me think here.

77
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,574
Um...

78
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,243
I don't know
any of these people.

79
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,678
It's an obligation.

80
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,314
I don't like talking paper
in my free time.

81
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,682
Or in my work time.

82
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:40,552
And... did I use
the word "pointless?"

83
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,988
Thanks for inviting me along.

84
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,122
Oh, sure.

85
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,557
Really didn't give it
any thought.

86
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,226
Wait, should you be going?

87
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,563
Hey-wo, you!

88
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,965
Michael?
Hey, buttercup.

89
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,267
I am on my way,
should be there in about 15...

90
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,969
Let's just blow this party off.

91
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,170
That's what she said.
Yeah.

92
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,105
Am I on speaker phone?

93
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,207
Ah, yes you are.

94
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,409
Is anybody else...
Hello, Jan!

95
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,611
Hi, Dwight.

96
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,045
Okay, Michael,
take me off speakerphone.

97
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,847
No le problem.

98
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,117
Okay, let's just go
to a motel...

99
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,185
Okay!

100
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,586
And, like, rip into each other

101
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,988
like we did
on that black sand beach

102
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,089
in Jamaica.

103
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,390
Hey, Jan?

104
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,226
Jan, this party is actually
a very big step for us.

105
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,629
So I...
Still on speaker?

106
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,732
Um... I don't know.

107
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,000
Are cameras there?

108
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,101
Maybe.

109
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,869
All right, see you soon.

110
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,237
Okay.
Talk to you later, Jan!

111
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,106
All right, bye.

112
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,440
Hey, Michael left early,

113
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,376
so a bunch of us
are gonna go to Poor Richard's

114
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,677
for happy hour, you should come.

115
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,013
I can't.

116
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,181
My brother just unloaded
the Jet Skis

117
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,584
and he kinda took a bath, so...

118
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,119
We're gonna go get hammered.

119
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,755
Okay, well, we're going
to a bar.

120
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,092
Hey.

121
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,061
You have to come
to stuff with me.

122
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,196
I'm serious.

123
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,298
If you're gonna be my boyfriend,

124
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,400
you have to do boyfriend things.

125
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:05,404
Okay.

126
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:09,341
I have decided that
I'm going to be more honest.

127
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,711
I'm gonna start telling people
what I want directly.

128
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:16,014
So look out world,
'cause ol' Pamie

129
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,216
is getting what she wants.

130
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,218
And don't call me Pamie.

131
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,287
Beauty.

132
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,122
Thank you, sir.

133
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,857
Ensalada.
Thank you.

134
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,063
You're dressed
exactly like the servants.

135
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,798
Shut up.

136
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,899
Okay, change shirts with me.

137
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,500
What?
Give me your shirt.

138
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,302
No, but yours won't fit me.

139
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,670
I don't care.

140
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,142
This is stupid.

141
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,978
Ah... wow.

142
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,414
Here.

143
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,782
Don't let my jacket...

144
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,651
Don't give me that.

145
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,720
That would have been
really embarrassing.

146
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,821
Yes.

147
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:56,822
Crisis averted.

148
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:57,989
Okay.

149
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,796
Oh.

150
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,264
That duck is so cute.

151
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,470
Hey, Pam.

152
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,940
Oscar.
Angela.

153
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:18,643
Uh, hi!

154
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,980
Actually, it's polite
to arrive early.

155
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,882
And smart.

156
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,151
Only really good friends
show up early.

157
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,653
Ergo de facto,
go to a party early,

158
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,889
become a really good friend.

159
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,157
Oh! Uh, potato salad.

160
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,358
Oh.
That's from both of us.

161
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,359
No, it's not.

162
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,194
It's my bowl.
Wonderful.

163
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,398
Let's, uh, see
where we can put this.

164
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,999
Okay.

165
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,267
Oh, you know what,
you probably wanna leave

166
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,269
the cover on
until the guests get here.

167
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,906
It's been sitting
in my car all day.

168
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,808
Sun beating down
on the mayonnaise...

169
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,846
Just... you never know.

170
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,516
Kevin, you and Stacey
set a date yet?

171
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,650
Yeah.

172
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,318
Oh, my God, when is it?

173
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,121
It's complicated.

174
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,724
I would appreciate
some space on this.

175
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,159
Hey!

176
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,827
Hey!

177
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,395
You made it.

178
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,097
Yeah, you said
it was important, so...

179
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,266
It is.

180
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,434
How's it going?

181
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,135
What's up, Pam?
Hey, Kenny.

182
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,870
Sorry about the Jet Skis.

183
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,441
You guys all want
a round? On me?

184
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:23,708
Yeah!

185
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,776
Let's get you a drink.

186
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,144
Thanks, man.
I'm thirsty.

187
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,579
No, thank you, Roy, I...

188
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,582
You should get a round, Ryan.

189
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:35,253
Oh, you know that line
on the top of the shrimp?

190
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:39,257
That's feces.

191
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,258
Whatcha looking for?

192
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,293
Did you bring dip?

193
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,762
I'm sure that it's catered.

194
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:46,264
I need you
to sign these, Michael.

195
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,233
That's a waiver
of some of your rights.

196
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,368
You should read it carefully.

197
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,770
It releases the company
in the event

198
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,405
that our relationship
in your opinion,

199
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,240
or in reality,
interferes with work.

200
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,844
You get a copy, I get a copy,
and a third copy goes to HR.

201
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,445
Awesome.

202
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,547
I'm gonna frame mine.

203
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,682
I could frame yours too.

204
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,984
You realize this is...
this is a legal document

205
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,019
that says you can't sue
the company?

206
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,822
Over our love.

207
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,459
I've... never told you
that I love you.

208
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,261
You don't have to, Jan.

209
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,196
This contract says it all.

210
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,899
I am taking a calculated risk.

211
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,133
What's the upside?

212
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,402
I overcome my nausea,
fall deeply in love,

213
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,838
babies, normalcy,
no more self-loathing.

214
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,309
Downside, I, uh,
date Michael Scott publicly

215
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,712
and collapse into myself
like a dying star.

216
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,816
What's this over the I?

217
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,886
It's a heart.

218
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,990
Why is this so hard?

219
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,126
That's what she said.

220
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,195
Oh, my God.
What am I saying?

221
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,564
I love this woman!

222
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,300
Oh, no, Michael,
please, Michael, please.

223
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:08,947
Do you ever watch
Battlestar Galactica?

224
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,015
No.
No?

225
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,550
Then you're an idiot.

226
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,584
Hello, Michael.

227
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,754
Rachel, boy,
do you clean up good.

228
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,390
Place looks great
with all the lights on.

229
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,824
And everything
actually looks bigger

230
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,326
with people in it, weird.

231
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,763
Jan, glad you could make it.

232
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,531
Oh, of course, of course, David.

233
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,899
Do you remember, uh,
Michael Scott?

234
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,200
Of course I do.
From Scranton branch.

235
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,201
How are you, Michael?

236
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,803
Jan and I are lovers.

237
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,005
That feels so good
to finally say that out loud.

238
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,409
David, can I, um,
speak to you privately

239
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,477
for just a moment, please?

240
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,579
Excuse me.

241
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,714
Okay.

242
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,519
Oh.

243
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,925
No. Actually, one of these
is supposed to be a light.

244
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,594
Oh, sorry.

245
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,698
So the merger goes smoothly,
or...

246
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
It did.
"Like butter."

247
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,435
Mike Myers, SNL.

248
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,036
You should ask Karen,
she was one of them.

249
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,504
Yeah, I'm the only one left.

250
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:09,074
Everybody else
was either fired or quit.

251
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,809
And there's one
in anger management.

252
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,844
Yeah, but you're great now,
right?

253
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,046
We're all great.

254
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,514
Aren't we great?

255
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,016
We're good.

256
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,086
Michael, st...
please stop that, okay?

257
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,153
Uh, can I get anyone anything?

258
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,055
I could go
for an appe-tease-er, yep.

259
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,790
Martini, please.
Bagel bites or something.

260
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,692
Rachel, your house is beautiful.

261
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,693
Oh, thank you.

262
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:29,694
What's the square footage?

263
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,396
Wow.

264
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,131
Uh, about 5,000.

265
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,566
Does that include the garage?

266
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,802
Dwight, that's not appropriate.

267
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,537
I don't know.
It's a common question.

268
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,439
David, how much
did this house cost?

269
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,944
These old colonials
are great... when they're sound.

270
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,313
I'd love to, uh,
take a look around.

271
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,081
I'll show you around, sure.

272
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,783
Cool, let's start
with the banisters.

273
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,518
Hey.

274
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,487
Do you see that guy behind you

275
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,189
in the blue blazer
against the wall?

276
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,424
Mm, yup.

277
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,059
That's Drake.

278
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,161
And just so you know,
I don't wanna be weird

279
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,364
or anything, but, um,
we used to date.

280
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,033
Oh.

281
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,834
Okay, cool.
Thanks for telling me that.

282
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,269
And it didn't end well.

283
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,838
Gotcha.

284
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,874
All right.

285
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,780
This was a gift...

286
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,382
from Lee lacocca.

287
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,085
20-year-old,
single malt Scotch.

288
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,855
Here is to Mr. Iacocca
and his failed experiment,

289
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,957
the DeLorean.

290
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,196
Are you okay?

291
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,297
Yeah!

292
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,398
Do you have any ice?

293
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,435
Sure.

294
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,936
How about some Splenda?

295
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,107
1, 2, 3, up chickens!

296
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,909
Down chickens!

297
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,910
Uh, I think I heard
the quarter over here.

298
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,011
Where?
On this side.

299
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,380
No, it is definitely
under one of these hands.

300
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,648
I kind of heard it
on Roy's side too.

301
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,416
No, it is here.

302
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,818
Not here.

303
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,319
Not here. Not here.

304
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,054
Not here.

305
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,656
Good thing you didn't listen
to me.

306
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,790
Yeah, close one.

307
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,860
Not here. Not here.

308
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,462
Okay, it's either here or here.

309
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,868
Not here.

310
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,504
Yes!

311
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:20,538
Nice job.

312
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,340
I can read you like a book.

313
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,374
Oh, yeah?

314
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,676
You can't keep anything from me.

315
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,812
Bottom's up.

316
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,681
Hey, Creed.
Hey.

317
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,682
What's up, Creed?

318
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:31,750
What are you guys up to?

319
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,818
Ah, hello.

320
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,253
You're the man, buddy.

321
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,523
I run a small fake ID company
from my car

322
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,658
with a laminating machine
that I swiped

323
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,227
from the sheriff's station.

324
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,064
Huh, yeah.

325
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,199
These studs
are way too far apart.

326
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,437
What's in here?

327
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,838
Ah, it's a guest room.

328
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,241
Just the one window?

329
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,576
Oh, I must get that.

330
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,744
You'll have to excuse me.

331
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,945
Are those real pearls?

332
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,147
Uh, yes.

333
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,381
They're...

334
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:08,787
Yes.

335
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,659
Good.

336
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,461
Well, it was nice
meeting you guys.

337
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,264
Take care.

338
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,766
Well, if you're wondering why
his wife was staring daggers

339
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,468
at me, it's because
I kinda saw him

340
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,969
for a little bit
when they were separated.

341
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,771
Oh.

342
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,072
Didn't notice.

343
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,141
Really? I thought
it was so obvious.

344
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,210
I'm glad it didn't make you
uncomfortable.

345
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,812
No, it was before I knew you,

346
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,446
so... it's fine.

347
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,449
Wow, this one really smells
like vanilla.

348
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,450
Mm.
Check that out.

349
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,451
That's nice.

350
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,720
You and the Mrs.
should join us

351
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,256
at Sandals Jamaica
next Christmas.

352
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,092
I...Michael, I think
David probably wants

353
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,761
to spend Christmas here
with his family.

354
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:50,895
Oh, yeah.

355
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,897
They don't allow kids
at Sandals.

356
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,733
They are... are
persona non grata.

357
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,035
Please stop.

358
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,736
They're... uh,
but it's fun.

359
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,004
It is an awesome place.

360
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,940
You would not believe
how low this girl can limbo.

361
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,708
David, I'm sorry.

362
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,909
You're just gonna
have to excuse us

363
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,477
for just a couple minutes,
sorry.

364
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,946
Okay, okay.

365
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,314
Excuse me.

366
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,715
What's going on?

367
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,983
What is it?

368
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,051
Sorry.

369
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,154
What... what's the matter?

370
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,489
What's...
Come here.

371
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,293
Just... just... just... just...

372
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,265
What are you doing?

373
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,833
Don't you know what I'm doing?

374
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,969
Yes, but you could tell me.

375
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,104
What are... what is that?

376
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,173
Why are you... why are we going
in the bathroom?

377
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,208
I thought this is where
you liked your privacy.

378
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,276
Shut up.

379
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,157
What has gotten into you?

380
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,525
No, no, no, no!
What?

381
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,927
Come on, let's go back
to the party.

382
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,629
Come on, wait,
let me just do my dress.

383
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,564
Don't take that... no!
Stop it! Stop it.

384
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,733
Jan, no, no, no!
Michael!

385
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,768
No means please don't.

386
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,203
Slam me up against the wall,
right here.

387
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,938
I'm not gonna slam you
up against anything.

388
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,640
Oh, please, I want you so...
You're acting inappropriate.

389
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,608
I'm acting inappropriate?
Jan... yeah.

390
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,010
Forget it, get away from me.

391
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,284
Here.

392
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,418
Hey.

393
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,586
Where have you been all night?

394
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,021
I was looking forward
to hanging out with you.

395
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,689
I was...

396
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,725
Hey, don't you have a daughter?

397
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,595
Yes.

398
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,070
Oh, good, you're up.

399
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,305
Hey, who makes' this chair?

400
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,941
I don't know,
it was here when I was born.

401
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,677
Hmm.
I want one.

402
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,679
Really good, solid construction.

403
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:48,680
It's comfortable.

404
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,516
What is this? Oak?

405
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,918
I don't know.

406
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,187
What do you know?

407
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,931
God, I hate these parties.

408
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,467
You wanna sneak out back
and shoot some hoops?

409
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,239
Meet me outside in two minutes.

410
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,977
You stay here and have fun,
'cause I'm gonna go out back

411
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,712
and shoot hoops
with David Wallace.

412
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,647
Okay.

413
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,750
Oh, um, don't mention
that you and I are dating,

414
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,286
'cause I think he might
still have feelings for me.

415
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,587
Wallace?

416
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,155
What the hell?

417
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,157
Have you dated, like,
every guy here?

418
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,398
Wow.

419
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,733
Okay.

420
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:42,734
You got me.

421
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,268
I so got you.

422
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,603
So, none of them.

423
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,372
Of course not.

424
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:50,808
I mean, you're kind of,
like, my first.

425
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,443
Really?

426
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,145
Oh, my God, it's so easy,
it's not even fun.

427
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,446
Okay.

428
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,385
Hey, Jan.

429
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,919
Not too good.

430
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,923
Did you get a chance to try

431
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,459
Michael's homemade potato salad?

432
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,328
Rachel thinks that I brought
homemade potato salad.

433
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,997
And I just picked it up
at the supermarket.

434
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,100
It's funny, I wish I could make
potato salad that good.

435
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,036
It's just potatoes
and mayonnaise.

436
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,605
There's something wrong
with Jan.

437
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,510
What's, uh, what's
with Jan and Michael?

438
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,912
I don't know.

439
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,048
Where to begin?

440
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,262
My ball.

441
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,863
The chimney's in decent shape.

442
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,266
Not great, I found
some termite damage

443
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,768
in a crawlspace
and some structural flaws

444
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,273
in the foundation,
so all in all...

445
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,109
it was a pretty fun
cocktail party.

446
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,447
What?

447
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,749
I want us to make it.

448
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,250
I want a fresh start.

449
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,852
That's awesome.

450
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,020
That's what I want.

451
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:12,490
Okay, but in order
for us to make it,

452
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,559
there can't be any secrets
between us.

453
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,427
The... I didn't do anything.

454
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,663
Ask anybody, I totally could've,

455
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:19,764
and I didn't at all.

456
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,499
Just listen.

457
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,268
Remember that casino night
about a month

458
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,903
before we were supposed
to get married?

459
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,605
I kissed Jim.

460
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,707
What?

461
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,844
He told me how he felt,
and I guess I had feelings too,

462
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:33,945
and we kissed.

463
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,113
Jim came on to you?

464
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,247
Just listen.

465
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,348
No, I am listening!

466
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,649
That's the problem,
I'm listening!

467
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,717
Don't yell.

468
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,385
Don't yell?

469
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,958
This is over.

470
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,260
Yeah, you're right,
this is so over.

471
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,162
You kidding me, Pam?

472
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,498
Come on!

473
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,100
God!

474
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:59,303
Damn Jet Skis!

475
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,010
Our first fight.

476
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,548
If this is about what happened
in the bathroom,

477
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,550
there was no place to cuddle.

478
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,852
I feel sick.

479
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,754
You didn't have any
of the potato salad, did you?

480
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,924
You know, we were good when we
were just running around.

481
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,159
You know, in secret.

482
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,960
It was wrong,
and it was exciting.

483
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:27,331
And maybe it was a mistake
to take it public.

484
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,771
Well, if that's the way
you feel,

485
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,440
my lady, then you
have hurt me greatly.

486
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,209
Michael.
Greatly.

487
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,610
Please don't cry.

488
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,778
I'm not going to cry.

489
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,548
I feel like it,
but I am not going to.

490
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,117
Why don't you just take
your stupid love contract

491
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,585
and tear it up
into a million pieces?

492
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,253
It was never
a love contract, Michael.

493
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,821
And besides, I've already given
a copy to David

494
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,089
and it would be
just as embarrassing

495
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,325
to get it back from him
as it was handing it to him.

496
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,661
I want the house, Jan!
I want the picket fence.

497
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,397
I want the ketchup fights,
and the tickling,

498
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,166
and the giggling.

499
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,703
I didn't mean it, okay?

500
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,005
I was... I was tired.
Whatever.

501
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,107
I'm tired,
and I didn't eat enough.

502
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,576
You didn't mean it.
And that's all.

503
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,110
That's was it.
That's it, you didn't mean it.

504
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,645
No, I didn't.
So...

505
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:19,083
That's all, I'm just saying
I didn't mean it.

506
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:22,987
I love you, Jan.

507
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,355
Okay.

508
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,596
Don't break up, you guys.

509
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,833
You're great together.

510
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,255
Are they gonna call the cops?

511
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,757
No, I paid them off.

512
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,027
Jet Ski money?

513
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,629
All of it.

514
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,697
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
