1
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:04,842
Coat!

2
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,449
Michael just rented
The Devil Wears Prada.

3
00:00:09,324 --> 00:00:11,622
He has his Netflix
sent here to the office,

4
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:14,958
and he watches them in
pieces when things are slow.

5
00:00:15,463 --> 00:00:16,725
Steak!

6
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,732
Where's my steak?

7
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:22,402
He's a big
Meryl Streep fan,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,871
so I shouldn't be surprised that
he's identified with her character.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,498
Get me Armani.

10
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:28,564
A suit?

11
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:30,076
On the phone.

12
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:31,203
Like the main
company number?

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,338
'Cause I'm gonna have to call information.
Where's Armani?

14
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:37,373
He's on the phone. Too slow.
You're not going to Paris.

15
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:38,942
I'm so much
better than you.

16
00:00:53,168 --> 00:00:55,159
I owe you an apology.

17
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:56,396
You finished the movie.

18
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:58,939
Yeah. It was awesome.
Big surprise ending.

19
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,031
Won't ruin it for you.

20
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:01,871
No. Go ahead.

21
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:04,673
Meryl Streep is the bad guy.
Never see it coming.

22
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:09,706
Anyway, if I was mean in any
way to you, I am sorry.

23
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,086
I just want what's
best for you, minooshka.

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,114
Minooshka.

25
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:22,095
Mo cuishle. He's watching
Million Dollar Baby.

26
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:27,592
He's gonna try to kill me.

27
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:03,202
So this one goes with my eyes, and
this one goes with your eyes.

28
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:05,161
People have said
I have very pretty eyes.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,468
You do.

30
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,669
I haven't heard the same about you.
So let's just go with mine.

31
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:12,304
Well, they both go with
the carpet that I've ordered,

32
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,440
and if we go with the brown leather on
the sofas then they go with that, too.

33
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:17,108
We already have
a sofa so why are...

34
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,709
A futon's not a sofa.

35
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:20,777
It folds up.
You've only seen it flat.

36
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:21,913
I know what
a futon is, Michael.

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,550
I... Okay. How much
is this gonna cost?

38
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,025
It costs what it costs.

39
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:27,584
No. That doesn't
even mean anything.

40
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:29,289
We have gone through this, okay.
We have gone through this.

41
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:34,434
Yes. Money has been a little bit tight
lately, but at the end of my life,

42
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:39,505
when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna
be thinking about how much money I have?

43
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:44,409
No. I'm going to be thinking
about how many friends I have,

44
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,609
and my children
and my comedy albums.

45
00:02:48,683 --> 00:02:52,483
I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously
did pretty well money-wise.

46
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:56,788
It's just, you know, you say
it's gonna cost what it...

47
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,984
Yeah? Michael,
it's Ryan for you.

48
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,757
Conniving little runt.
Put him through.

49
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,458
Put him through.
Yes? Ryan, my man.

50
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,262
I sent you an e-mail about
the new PowerPoint.

51
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:08,802
Yes. And thank you
for sending that to me.

52
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,668
I had IT install the updated
PowerPoint on your computer

53
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,366
so you can use it
for the presentation.

54
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:15,204
I really want people
there using PowerPoint.

55
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:17,540
Okay. Yeah.
No, I don't know.

56
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:19,580
I don't know. I think
those IT guys messed up.

57
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:20,978
Hold on.
I'll get them on the phone.

58
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,744
Wait. No. Here it is.
Here it is. F'ound it.

59
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:24,544
Sure.
I can hold.

60
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:28,381
Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight Schrute.

61
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:29,787
Please hold.

62
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:44,904
Schrute F'arms, Guten Tag.
How can I help you?

63
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:49,934
Yes, we have availability on those nights.
How many in your party?

64
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:55,448
Oh, no. I'm sorry. No king beds.
No queen either.

65
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:59,714
Well, we make our own mattresses that
don't conform to the traditional sizes.

66
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:01,652
Closest would be twin.

67
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:05,688
Thank you so much for calling.
Call back again. Auf Wiedersehen.

68
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,654
Hey, Dwight.

69
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:11,221
None of your
business, Jim.

70
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:12,323
You running
a bed and breakfast?

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,697
It is not a B&B.

72
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:16,828
Agrotourism is a lot more
than a bed and breakfast.

73
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:22,035
It consists of tourists coming
to a farm, showing them around,

74
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,204
giving them a bed,
giving them breakfast.

75
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:29,278
Does the Department
of Health know about this?

76
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,908
I am not telling you anything.

77
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:32,282
Permits are pending.

78
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:34,577
Dwight Schrute,
Dunder Mifflin.

79
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:35,679
Hello.
I'm looking for a room.

80
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:38,726
Okay. This is a misuse
of company phones.

81
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:41,227
It says here you
cater to the elderly.

82
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:42,284
Where did you read that?

83
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:43,990
Trip Advisor.

84
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:49,464
Trip Advisor is the lifeblood
of the agrotourism industry.

85
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:52,529
A couple of bad reviews there,
you may as well close up shop.

86
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,632
That's what took down
the Stalk Inn,

87
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,041
one of the cutest little
asparagus farms you'll ever see.

88
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:01,037
How many in your party?

89
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,139
Two.

90
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:05,310
We offer tours of the
fields and of the barn.

91
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,822
Perhaps you'd be interested in
Mose's table-making demonstration?

92
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,325
So, I forgot to tell you
that I need the car tonight.

93
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:15,851
Oh, actually
I need the car.

94
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,591
Why? F'or improv?

95
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:21,496
Why don't you just pretend
that you have a car?

96
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:26,568
Good practice in case you ever do a scene
where you need to pretend you have a car.

97
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:30,441
Used to have two cars, traded them in.
Now we're down to one.

98
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:35,813
Good economic sense, although the
new car's a Porsche, for her.

99
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,616
One cardigan.

100
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:42,085
One sleeping cardigan.

101
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,255
One sleep apnea mask.

102
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,526
What about my
cherub figurine?

103
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:51,758
You took that with you.

104
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,358
No. I left it
on my night...

105
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:56,460
Your night table,
by the lamp.

106
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:58,402
You are incorrect.

107
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:02,068
I was recently scrubbing my room of
memories, and I didn't see it there.

108
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:04,269
F'ine.

109
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:06,609
My girlfriend
and I broke up recently,

110
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:09,411
and I must say
I am relieved.

111
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,918
It gives me a chance
to sow my wild oats.

112
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:13,283
In the Schrute family,

113
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:16,949
we have a tradition where when the
male has sex with another woman,

114
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:21,723
he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats
left on his doorstep by his parents.

115
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:25,163
You can use those oats to make
oatmeal, bread, whatever you want.

116
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,167
I don't care.
They're your oats.

117
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:32,434
The bar uses an applause meter.
That's why it is so important

118
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:37,604
that you all come and applaud only
for my band, Scrantonicity II.

119
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:41,546
Not Scrantonicity, which I
am no longer a part of.

120
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:44,207
Michael, can I count on you?

121
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:45,912
You cannot.
I have a thing tonight.

122
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:47,276
Damn it.

123
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,217
Michael.

124
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:52,221
What?
That reminds me.

125
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:54,261
If the invitation
still stands,

126
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,161
Pam and I would love
to have dinner tonight.

127
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,927
Oh, no.
I have a thing tonight.

128
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,700
That stinks.
Darn it.

129
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,964
Shoot.

130
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:06,006
How about this weekend?
No. Can't.

131
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:10,510
We only had tonight free, and we
really wanted to spend it with you.

132
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:13,809
Damn it to hell.
Okay, all right.

133
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:15,746
What do you got
going on tonight?

134
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,779
You wouldn't understand.
It's a secret.

135
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,611
I wouldn't understand
or it's a secret?

136
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:24,556
You wouldn't understand, Jim.
It's a secret.

137
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:35,264
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien. I didn't
mean to interrupt your dinner.

138
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,065
I just have a very
exciting offer.

139
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:41,268
My records indicate that you have
expressed interest in losing some weight.

140
00:07:41,342 --> 00:07:42,400
Well, what if I told you

141
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:45,877
that I have a pill that will make you
50 pounds lighter in five minutes?

142
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:47,278
How would that sound?

143
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:48,508
Amazing, right?

144
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:51,517
Well, it won't be
that fast, but it will...

145
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,281
It will be that easy.

146
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:59,725
I can't believe
this place is real.

147
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:02,422
I mean, I've heard about his beet farm
for years, but I never thought...

148
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:03,724
The Beets Motel.

149
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,698
The Beets Motel?

150
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,427
That is... Wow.

151
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,866
Thank you.

152
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,960
The Borscht Hotel.

153
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,867
The Embassy Beets.
Radish Inn.

154
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:14,965
How are you doing this?

155
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:16,509
I don't know.

156
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:26,785
Oh, my gosh.

157
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:38,762
I just love sales. I love it to death.
It's as simple as that.

158
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,000
And I don't get to do enough of it as
a manager, so I took this second job

159
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:46,433
kind of as a hobby.

160
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:50,165
Some people have
golf or relaxing...

161
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,172
What's going on here?

162
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:56,148
Hey. I just got off the phone, and
I was gonna make another call.

163
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,782
We're a legit operation with a license
from the city. I can show you.

164
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,788
We pay minimum wage
against commission.

165
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:07,089
Nope. They're with me, so... This is
Nick F'igaro, manager to the stars.

166
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:10,891
We have three rooms,
each with a different theme.

167
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:12,432
What are the themes?

168
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,129
America, Irrigation
and Nighttime.

169
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:17,192
Irrigation.

170
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,329
Nice.

171
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:20,636
I'll put you down
for Irrigation.

172
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,905
Now then, do you have any special
needs or dietary restrictions?

173
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:26,811
Yes. We will be requiring
a bedtime story.

174
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:28,572
No.

175
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,948
Not even Harry Potter?
No, Jim, come on.

176
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:34,215
- But you promised...
- Mose, bags, now.

177
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:41,191
Here we are.
Irrigation room.

178
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:45,562
A very special room. So I'll come get you
before the table-making demonstration.

179
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:49,660
And as of this morning, we are completely
wireless here at Schrute F'arms,

180
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:52,035
but as soon as I find out
where Mose hid all the wires,

181
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,937
we'll get that power back on.

182
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,373
All righty.

183
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:04,649
Everybody in the conference
room in five minutes.

184
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:09,114
These meetings are useless.

185
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:11,925
I just want to remind you
to stick to the script.

186
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,960
It's been proven
to work, so...

187
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:19,992
Got it?

188
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,625
Very inspirational.

189
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:28,166
We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to
the guy with the most sales, okay?

190
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:29,436
Or a woman.

191
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,205
Or a trained seal.

192
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,180
You can make jokes when you've
made a sale there, rookie. Okay?

193
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,716
I'd say one in six.

194
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:45,952
What?

195
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:49,689
I thought you asked me what our chances
were of being murdered here tonight.

196
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:54,394
You know, I just realized this is Pam's
and my first night away together.

197
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:57,666
I used to play it
over in my head,

198
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:00,263
and it was just
a little bit different.

199
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:06,712
Maybe a nice hotel or a
romantic dinner, wine,

200
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,511
but wine that wasn't
made out of beets.

201
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:11,909
Didn't think Dwight
would be involved at all.

202
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:15,979
And I always
imagine less manure.

203
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:19,321
I mean some manure,
just less.

204
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:20,587
This is beet food.

205
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:24,427
Mose, what are you doing?
No, Mose. Put the manure down.

206
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:27,296
Put it down! Do not throw it!
Do not...

207
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,427
Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?

208
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:30,492
Yeah. Who is this?

209
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,506
Well, I'm just calling because
you responded positively to...

210
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:34,802
Michael?

211
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,338
Stanley?

212
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:40,277
Why are you calling
me here at home?

213
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:43,009
Señor, are you happy with
your long-distance service?

214
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,416
Michael, I know that's you. Why
are you calling me here at home?

215
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:48,685
Have you...

216
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:50,690
Have you considered
satellite television?

217
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:52,988
Michael, I know that's you.
I know your voice.

218
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,049
All right.

219
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:56,255
Why are you calling
me here at home?

220
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:59,323
When I'm at home,
at night, in my own house,

221
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,801
in my sweats drinking some red
wine, watching my mystery stories,

222
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,100
the last thing in
the whole godforsaken world

223
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:07,902
I want to hear is the
voice of Michael Scott.

224
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:09,636
Well, your son sounds
like he's really motivated.

225
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,543
I think it's crazy that the
coach won't play him, frankly.

226
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:14,972
My office.

227
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,482
You bet.

228
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,849
Just dial the number on the
sheet and stick to the script.

229
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,081
Say those words
exactly, got it?

230
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:24,317
I don't know why we have to
keep having this conversation.

231
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:28,350
Look, I know sales, and I had that sale.
I just needed a few more minutes to...

232
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:30,590
A few more minutes
is a waste of our time.

233
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:32,427
It's not a waste of time.
This is a trading game.

234
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:34,057
No. Look.
You give a quick pitch,

235
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:36,568
you make the sale, you move on.
That's how Vikram does it.

236
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:38,434
Vikram doesn't have
my people skills.

237
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:40,996
Good for Vikram, because he
outsells you every night.

238
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,836
No. Well, I hope
this conversation has helped.

239
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,175
"And Harry saw the white
hand raise its wand

240
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,813
"and felt Voldermort's
surge of vicious anger.

241
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,949
"Saw the frail old man
on the floor writhe in agony.

242
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:01,483
"'Harry.' It was over
as quickly as it had come.

243
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,325
"Harry stood shaking
in the darkness,

244
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:06,491
"clutching the gate into the
garden, his heart racing."

245
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,800
What you got tonight?

246
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:14,534
It looks like mixed masala,
eggplant and rice.

247
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,337
Oh, that looks good.

248
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,208
And what about you?
Peanut butter flavor again?

249
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:23,914
I am going with the vanilla
crisp this evening.

250
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:25,008
Enjoy.

251
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:26,484
Thank you.

252
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,114
I was a surgeon back home.

253
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:32,488
Really?
Yeah.

254
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,651
Wonder what I would
have been back home.

255
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,194
Well, this is your home.

256
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:39,722
I know, but it's so
competitive here.

257
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,268
What's $1 worth
in your land?

258
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:45,999
Medical school must have cost like
40 bucks or a donkey or something.

259
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,835
Uh, no.

260
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:52,508
I would have been
chief of surgery.

261
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:57,182
Or a cowboy.

262
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:04,018
Wait, you're
going out there?

263
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:06,150
Yeah. Coward.

264
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:26,342
Oh, my God.
What century is this?

265
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,414
You know what, here's the
thing about Die Hard 4.

266
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:36,218
Die Hard 1, the original, John McClane
is just this normal guy, you know?

267
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,383
He's just a normal
New York City cop

268
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,896
who gets his feet cut, and he gets
beat up, but he's an everyday guy.

269
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:48,401
In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a
motorcycle into a helicopter in the air.

270
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:49,663
Yeah.

271
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:50,999
You know? He's invincible.

272
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:54,268
It just sort of lost what Die Hard was.
It's not Terminator.

273
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,741
Dude, you should
review movies.

274
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,368
Oh, my God. Yes.

275
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,538
I'm telling you.
Yeah. You should.

276
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:02,172
I actually wrote a movie.
Really?

277
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:03,511
Well, I'm writing one, yeah.

278
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,017
What's it about?

279
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,609
Sort of a spy thriller.

280
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,655
Hey, what's so captivating?

281
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,358
I love captivating things,

282
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:16,260
and this must really be captivating
because it's keeping you off the phones.

283
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,857
I mean, time is your money. That's
how I know how captivating it is

284
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:22,458
because of how much time
you've spent talking.

285
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:29,866
Your turn.

286
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,056
Come in. Did you have
another nightmare?

287
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,631
Hey, Dwight.

288
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,863
Oh, Jim.

289
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:00,930
I thought you were Mose.

290
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:03,169
Does Mose have nightmares?

291
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:05,768
Oh, yes.
Ever since the storm.

292
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:13,348
Is everything satisfactory
with your stay?

293
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:15,418
Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:17,286
Great.

295
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:22,556
Just thought I heard crying or
moaning or something in here.

296
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:27,256
Oh, well, I'll look into
that in the morning.

297
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:33,566
Thank you for bringing that
to the attention of the staff.

298
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:36,704
Good night, Dwight.

299
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:56,629
Hey, so we're all gonna go out for a beer.
You want to come?

300
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:57,857
We'd love for you
to come, Michael.

301
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,297
Thanks, no. I have to work
in the morning, so...

302
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:01,595
All right.
Next time, dude.

303
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,260
Okay. See you guys.

304
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:07,234
Hey, how you doing?

305
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:09,775
You drive.
I had too much wine.

306
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:10,969
Okay.

307
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,676
How was yoga?

308
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:15,715
I didn't go.
Why?

309
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:17,716
Why not?
I just didn't.

310
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:18,808
Okay.

311
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:20,376
How was improv?

312
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,321
Good night, Vikram.
Good night.

313
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,380
Hey, congrats
on the bonus.

314
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:26,517
Thank you, Michael.

315
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:27,924
I'm gonna nab it
one of these nights.

316
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:31,624
Well, if you concentrate and
make your calls faster, yeah.

317
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:36,136
Good night.
Good night.

318
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:45,439
Michael.
Mmm.

319
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:49,204
Morning.
Hi.

320
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:59,522
Hey, Dwight.
How are you?

321
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:00,651
Pam.

322
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,091
You okay?

323
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:08,431
I am better than you have
ever been or ever will be.

324
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:15,841
Hey, guys. What's happening?
How's my favorite branch doing?

325
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,836
Okay, Michael, why don't
you start us off?

326
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:20,902
Um...

327
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:23,941
That wasn't much
of an introduction.

328
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:27,513
Ladies and gentlemen,
your boss, Michael Scott.

329
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:29,885
Oh, still lame. Okay.

330
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:32,255
All right.

331
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:37,496
Thank you, Ryan, for that
wonderful introduction.

332
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:43,067
Okay, today we're
going to be talking

333
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:47,904
about PowerPoint.

334
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,979
PowerPoint. PowerPoint.
PowerPoint.

335
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,608
Yes, I forgot about Ryan's presentation,
and yes, it would have been nice

336
00:18:57,684 --> 00:19:00,778
to do well with the first
presentation that he had given me.

337
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:02,947
But you know what else
would have been nice?

338
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:05,253
Winning the lottery.

339
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:09,728
And the best way
to start is to hit "Start,"

340
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:13,994
and up comes the tool bar,
that's what she said.

341
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:19,004
What we have to do
here is go to "Run,"

342
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:25,307
and then you look
up to "PowerPoint."

343
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:27,976
And we are in.

344
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:31,711
We are going to register.
You hit "Register."

345
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:34,346
Updates are ready.
I should update.

346
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:38,549
"Estimated time 12 minutes."

347
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,957
So this should take
about five or 10 minutes.

348
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,053
Is this the first time
you've opened PowerPoint?

349
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,461
Why?

350
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,089
You didn't prepare a
presentation at all, did you?

351
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,727
No. I had a really rough night, and
my boss can back me up on that.

352
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:51,031
I'm your boss.

353
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:52,696
My other boss,
Mr. F'igaro.

354
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:54,536
You have another job?

355
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:59,272
What I do between 5:30 p.m. And 1:00 a.m.
Is nobody's business but mine

356
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,337
and my other business'.

357
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:03,474
Are you a cocktail waitress?

358
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,745
You cannot have
a second job

359
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,912
if it affects your work here.
It won't.

360
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:09,046
It did already.

361
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:11,181
Okay, honestly,

362
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:14,716
it is unlikely that I was
gonna figure this out anyway.

363
00:20:16,963 --> 00:20:17,987
You're so funny.

364
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:19,089
Why is Darryl here?

365
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,155
He works
in the warehouse.

366
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:21,222
I invited him.

367
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:24,668
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs.
This isn't information you need.

368
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:28,174
This information here, yeah,
you're right, I don't need this.

369
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:30,300
Okay.

370
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:34,080
Hey, come on.

371
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:36,516
See you later tonight.

372
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,607
I got plans later.

373
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,311
Okay.
Bye, honey.

374
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:47,554
How long until you actually
get this presentation ready?

375
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:49,288
Why don't you do the presentation?
Honestly...

376
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:50,887
Because I don't want... I
mean, you know how to do it.

377
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,660
What I really want, honestly,
Michael, is for you to know it

378
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:55,531
so that you can communicate
it to the people here,

379
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,035
to your clients,
to whomever.

380
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:58,162
Okay.

381
00:20:58,238 --> 00:20:59,535
What?

382
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:00,937
It's whoever,
not whomever.

383
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,235
No, it's whomever.

384
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:03,936
No. Whomever is
never actually right.

385
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,102
Well, sometimes
it's right.

386
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:08,443
Michael is right. It's a made-up
word used to trick students.

387
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:12,315
No. Actually whomever is the
formal version of the word.

388
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:15,651
Obviously it's a real word, but I
don't know when to use it correctly.

389
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:17,713
Not a native speaker.
I know what's right,

390
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,086
but I'm not gonna say

391
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,128
because you're all jerks who didn't
come see my band last night.

392
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:23,184
Do you really know
which one is correct?

393
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:24,287
I don't know.

394
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:27,765
It's whom when it's the object of a
sentence and who when it's the subject.

395
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,893
That sounds right. Well, it
sounds right, but is it?

396
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,904
How did Ryan use it? As an object?
As an object.

397
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,530
Ryan used me
as an object.

398
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:34,801
Is he right about that?

399
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,933
How did he
use it again?

400
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:40,673
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to
explain the computer system, the object...

401
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:42,874
Thank you.
...to whomever, meaning us,

402
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:46,112
the indirect object, which is
the correct usage of the word.

403
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:50,384
No one asked you anything, ever.
So whomever's name is Toby,

404
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:52,789
why don't you take a letter opener
and stick it in your skull?

405
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,794
Hey, this doesn't matter,
and I don't even care.

406
00:21:55,862 --> 00:21:58,729
Michael, you quit the other
job or you're fired here.

407
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:05,470
I've never done this before.

408
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:08,975
I have never quit
anything in my life.

409
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:13,772
So you are filming history.

410
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:17,476
Nick, I had a dream last night
that I had two full-time jobs.

411
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:21,311
One here at the lipaphadrazone
diet pill company.

412
00:22:21,388 --> 00:22:23,288
Lipophedrine.
And in the other,

413
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,349
I was a regional manager of a small paper
supply company called Dunder Mifflin.

414
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:28,451
Never heard of it.

415
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:29,552
In this dream,

416
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:35,795
I did both of these jobs beautifully
and I loved it and everybody loved me.

417
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:39,168
The truth is,
I can't do this.

418
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,866
Are you quitting?

419
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:43,473
I am.

420
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:47,240
Come back anytime. Don't forget
to disinfect your headset.

421
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:51,383
I was never in this
for the money.

422
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,450
But it turns out that the money
was an absolute necessity for me.

423
00:22:57,924 --> 00:23:02,293
I tried to live the dream, I tried
to have a job, a girlfriend,

424
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:05,921
another job, and I failed.

425
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:12,833
But the good thing about the American
dream is that you can just go to sleep

426
00:23:14,508 --> 00:23:17,033
and try it all again
the next night.

427
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,608
So...

428
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:29,410
What's up?

429
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:30,581
Me. All night.

430
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:33,148
Dreaming about Angela's
smoking hot body.

431
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:34,318
You're being gross.

432
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:36,362
Not from
a male perspective.

433
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:39,728
You need to set me up with her. I
know she told you that she's looking,

434
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,267
and she's totally not
responding to my moves.

435
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:43,359
What moves?

436
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,496
I have moonwalked past
accounting like 10 times.

437
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:47,835
I can't believe
that's not working.

438
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:48,897
Yeah.

439
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:49,964
Um...

440
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:53,408
I don't know if I really
see you two together.

441
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,213
Really? Well, maybe you should look
in the smart part of your brain.

442
00:23:58,285 --> 00:23:59,445
She's very religious.

443
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,149
Okay, well, I come from a line of
WASPs so long it leads back to Moses.

444
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:08,422
Okay, well, she takes her convictions pretty
seriously. She can be kind of severe.

445
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:10,429
Yeah, and I punched
a hole in a wall.

446
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:12,465
That's right. You did. Yeah.

447
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:16,400
Now that I think about it, Angela and
Andy might actually make a good couple.

448
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:19,803
But I couldn't
do that to Dwight.

449
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:21,573
Or Angela.

450
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:23,973
Or Andy.

451
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:31,181
Hey, Kevin,
you're a gambler, right?

452
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:36,918
A rounder? You play the
ponies, small horses?

453
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:39,388
I do gamble, Michael.

454
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:42,928
Yeah. I was thinking about
doing some gambling myself.

455
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:44,691
You know, just a
little bit of money.

456
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,290
Maybe doubling it, then
doubling it several more times.

457
00:24:48,368 --> 00:24:50,893
I don't know,
kind of just for fun.

458
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:55,874
I was thinking, do you have any
tips or ideas about sure things?

459
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,802
Like a boxer

460
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:04,145
who is gonna throw
the big fight?

461
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:07,983
You know, like he's tied
into some crooked dealings

462
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:12,047
and maybe his kid is sick or something?
Like, who do I call about that?

463
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:14,620
The mob.

464
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:18,329
Do you know
anybody in the mob?

465
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,259
Okay.

466
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:26,566
Oscar,

467
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:30,806
I'm gonna need to take another
advance on my salary.

468
00:25:31,244 --> 00:25:32,871
What do you mean
you have plans tonight?

469
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:35,938
I have my daughter tonight.
We're renting Charlotte's Web.

470
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:37,506
Well, you have
to make a choice.

471
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:39,051
It's either your
daughter or me.

472
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,643
My daughter.

473
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:42,243
Okay.

474
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:45,050
That's how it is.

475
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,949
Oops!

476
00:25:52,232 --> 00:25:53,722
That was cold.

477
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:02,132
He's always been
terrible with money.

478
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:05,006
I bet it's Jan spending him
straight to the poorhouse.

479
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:07,273
Yeah.
Women be shopping.

480
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:09,508
I can't believe he
has a second job.

481
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:10,947
He's not even good
at his first one.

482
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:12,245
Hey, guys.

483
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:13,307
Shh.

484
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:18,048
What you talking about?

485
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:22,819
Okay. I know what's going on.
You're talking about Jim and Pam,

486
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:24,056
if they're having sex,

487
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,654
what it looks like, and I think...
Michael.

488
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:27,222
Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:31,598
Michael, are you
having money problems?

490
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:34,071
Monkey problems? No, I'm not
having monkey problems.

491
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,767
Why would I have
monkey problems?

492
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:37,002
I know you
heard me correctly.

493
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:38,567
Oh, I hate monkeys.

494
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:41,511
What's going on? Why do
you have a second job?

495
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:43,378
I don't have a second job.

496
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,784
Maybe I am having an affair
with Suzanne Somers.

497
00:26:47,854 --> 00:26:49,082
Doesn't Jan have money?

498
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:50,713
I don't talk to my
girlfriend about money.

499
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,485
It is rude and unsexual.

500
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,583
True.

501
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,992
It's best to hide our money
problems from women.

502
00:26:56,062 --> 00:27:00,362
I totally agree with you, but
I don't have money problems.

503
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:03,027
All right, you know what?
Watch this.

504
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:08,966
If I had money problems,
would I do this?

505
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:18,473
Well...

506
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:19,575
You just put
it back in your pocket.

507
00:27:19,652 --> 00:27:20,744
Yeah.

508
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,914
Yeah, but I destroyed it.
It's not even useable anymore.

509
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:30,227
Hey, let's call
this what it is.

510
00:27:32,565 --> 00:27:36,023
It's like she only wants to
hook up when Ryan comes around.

511
00:27:36,102 --> 00:27:37,694
It's gotten to the point
where I get excited

512
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:41,036
every time I see that little
dude walk through the door.

513
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:44,768
Well, I just need to know
where this is going.

514
00:27:44,844 --> 00:27:47,404
Hey, I like you.

515
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:49,737
All right?

516
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,879
What's not to like?

517
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,080
But you need to access
your un-crazy side.

518
00:27:57,157 --> 00:28:00,149
Otherwise maybe this thing
has run its course.

519
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:04,653
Don't you dare walk away
from me, Darryl Philbin.

520
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:05,789
You are the most
selfish person

521
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:07,264
I have ever
met in my entire...

522
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,597
Slow down.
Think it over.

523
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:15,702
Darryl Philbin is the most
complicated man that I've ever met.

524
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:18,767
I mean, who says exactly
what they're thinking?

525
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,246
What kind of game is that?

526
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:28,710
Hey, cuz. Heard you're
having money problems.

527
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:29,948
No, you didn't.

528
00:28:30,023 --> 00:28:31,422
Listen,
I got the answer.

529
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:34,824
You declare bankruptcy,
all your problems go away.

530
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:36,657
Creed Bratton has never
declared bankruptcy.

531
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:38,356
When Creed Bratton
gets in trouble,

532
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:42,492
he transfers his debt
to William Charles Schneider.

533
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:46,399
How would that help, Creed? In
Monopoly, you go bankrupt, you lose.

534
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:50,067
You don't go by Monopoly, man.
That game is nuts.

535
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:53,340
Nobody just picks up
Get Out of Jail F'ree cards.

536
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:55,313
Those things
cost thousands.

537
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,706
That is a good point.

538
00:28:57,784 --> 00:29:00,617
Bankruptcy, Michael,
is nature's do-over.

539
00:29:00,687 --> 00:29:03,121
It's a fresh start.
It's a clean slate.

540
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:05,020
Like the witness
protection program.

541
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,888
Exactly.
Not at all.

542
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:10,930
I've always wanted to be in the
witness protection program.

543
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:13,795
F'resh start.
No debts, no baggage.

544
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:18,270
I've already got my name picked
out, Lord Rupert Everton.

545
00:29:18,338 --> 00:29:23,037
I'm a shipping merchant
who raises fancy dogs.

546
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:24,701
That's the life.

547
00:29:30,516 --> 00:29:35,715
I declare bankruptcy!

548
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:48,127
Hey. I just wanted
you to know

549
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:51,659
that you can't just say the word
bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.

550
00:29:51,738 --> 00:29:53,672
I didn't say it.
I declared it.

551
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,231
Still.
That's not anything.

552
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:59,441
This is a lot of
credit card debt.

553
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:01,070
Yeah. Tell me about it.

554
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,311
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and
she's using them as if I'm made of money.

555
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,946
She thinks I'm
a human ATM machine.

556
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:11,557
Okay, $125 at Amazon.

557
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:15,617
Oh, best of The Muppet Show on DVD.
Classic.

558
00:30:16,696 --> 00:30:19,529
$1,200. What's a Core
Blaster Extreme?

559
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:23,625
That is by far the best way
to strengthen your core.

560
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:28,868
This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball,
you put your feet into the power stirrups,

561
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:31,410
you reach up and you
grab onto the super rod,

562
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:37,006
and you twist and you twist and you twist.
It strengthens your entire core,

563
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:41,986
your back core,
your arm core, your...

564
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:46,389
The Marine Corps actually uses it.
I think that's how they got corps.

565
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:54,431
I left a little
present for Angela.

566
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,627
I think she's
going to like it

567
00:30:56,703 --> 00:30:59,968
'cause I found it outside
Vance Refrigeration all alone,

568
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:04,100
and I told her in the note
that the cat came to find her,

569
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:06,873
that they were
destined to be together.

570
00:31:10,283 --> 00:31:11,648
I got game.

571
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,090
Okay, the green bar is what you spend
every month on stuff you need,

572
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,060
like a car and a house.

573
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:26,189
That's so cool how you
have my name at the top.

574
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:31,827
The red bar is what you
spend on non-essentials,

575
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:33,701
like magazines, entertainment.
Right.

576
00:31:33,773 --> 00:31:35,206
Things like that.

577
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:41,975
This scary black bar is what you spend
on things that no one ever, ever needs,

578
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:45,176
like multiple magic sets,
professional bass fishing equipment.

579
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:48,414
How did you do this so fast?
Is this PowerPoint?

580
00:31:58,531 --> 00:31:59,759
Oh, man.

581
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:06,033
Angela really had
a hold on him. Angela.

582
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:08,699
Michael, I'm gonna set you and
Jan up with a debt consolidator.

583
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,037
You meet with this guy...
No. No.

584
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,839
We are going to
leave Jan out of this.

585
00:32:12,912 --> 00:32:14,140
She has to know.

586
00:32:14,213 --> 00:32:15,703
We will find
another way.

587
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:17,807
We'll ask PowerPoint.

588
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:19,374
Michael, this is a
presentation tool.

589
00:32:19,452 --> 00:32:22,819
You're a presentation tool if you
think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.

590
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:25,084
I'm done. No, you're not...
Okay. Just...

591
00:32:25,158 --> 00:32:28,355
You're not a tool. Look, we'll
tell her that it's bad,

592
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:32,990
but it could have been a lot worse, but
due to some fancy financial footwork,

593
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,193
I was able to
cut it in half.

594
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:38,093
Jan is smart.

595
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,297
She poses.

596
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:45,133
Dwight, how's the
hotel business?

597
00:32:45,211 --> 00:32:46,542
Stupid.

598
00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:49,938
Have you checked
Trip Advisor recently?

599
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,244
No.

600
00:32:52,718 --> 00:32:54,447
Maybe you should.

601
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,683
Maybe you should...
Whatever.

602
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:04,424
We wrote a good review.
Under "Comments," we wrote,

603
00:33:04,497 --> 00:33:07,227
"The natural aroma of the beets
drifts into the bedrooms

604
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,495
"and makes you dream
of simpler times."

605
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:13,198
"The dawn goose walk will
tug at your heart strings."

606
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:16,139
"Table-making
never seemed so possible."

607
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:19,269
"You will never
want to leave your room."

608
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:23,008
"The architecture reminds one
of a quaint Tuscan beet farm."

609
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,581
I'm glad you
enjoyed your stay.

610
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:31,782
We really did.
It was fun.

611
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:42,796
So due to Michael's
clever financial maneuvering,

612
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:45,804
he finds himself
tremendously in debt.

613
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:47,396
You're broke?

614
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:51,039
How did you get that
from what Oscar said?

615
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,772
How... I mean, Michael,
how did this happen?

616
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:56,076
Where exactly did
your money go?

617
00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:01,179
I don't... I don't get this.
I really don't. I don't...

618
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:07,523
I don't understand how you
could be so irresponsible.

619
00:34:07,593 --> 00:34:13,122
I mean, it is
astounding to me, really.

620
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:14,494
I don't know what
more to say, it's just...

621
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,091
Jan?

622
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:18,194
Yeah? What?
Michael left.

623
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:21,433
Okay.
Where did he go?

624
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:23,065
I don't know.

625
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,203
Well, is he
coming right back?

626
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:28,008
I don't think so.

627
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,179
I'll be right there.

628
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:53,165
What am I doing?
I am blowing Dodge.

629
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,208
I'm getting out of town.

630
00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:59,802
Whatever you call it, I am running
away from my responsibilities.

631
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,670
It feels good.

632
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:09,318
You may ask me
out to dinner.

633
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:16,019
Nothing fancy or foreign. No bars, no
patios, no vegetables and no seafood.

634
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:25,731
Dwight?

635
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:52,024
Did I ever tell you why
I left Scranton?

636
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,160
Yeah, I didn't
think I had.

637
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,662
Well, it was all
about Pam.

638
00:36:03,776 --> 00:36:08,236
Yeah. I mean,
she was with Roy,

639
00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:11,673
and I just
couldn't take it.

640
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:15,277
I mean,
I lost it, Dwight.

641
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:21,687
I couldn't sleep. I couldn't
concentrate on anything.

642
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,692
And weird stuff,
like food had no taste.

643
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:33,301
So my solution was
to move away.

644
00:36:35,508 --> 00:36:36,975
It was awful.

645
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:42,408
And it is something that I
wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

646
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:47,983
And that includes you.

647
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:25,886
Hey, I was thinking
about dinner, we...

648
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:35,027
Dinner. Let's see,
maybe we should try

649
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,228
the new Italian place where
the dry cleaner used to be.

650
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:38,361
Okay.
Yeah?

651
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:40,337
Yeah.
Okay.

652
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:46,069
Jim's just really passionate
about Italian food.

653
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:51,880
Yeah. I'm very passionate
about Italian food.

654
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:57,978
In fact, I'm in love
with Italian food.

655
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:08,194
Jan, he went
running that way.

656
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:10,394
Okay, great.
Thanks.

657
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:17,332
Runaway train,
never coming back

658
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:21,336
Run away
and I'm never coming back

659
00:38:21,414 --> 00:38:22,676
Michael?

660
00:38:23,616 --> 00:38:24,844
Hey, Jan.

661
00:38:27,186 --> 00:38:28,778
What's going on?

662
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:32,781
Not much.
What's up with you?

663
00:38:32,858 --> 00:38:34,257
Well, why are you
sitting on a train?

664
00:38:34,326 --> 00:38:35,418
Where are you going?

665
00:38:35,494 --> 00:38:37,291
I am out
of answers, Jan.

666
00:38:37,363 --> 00:38:38,830
What does that mean?

667
00:38:38,898 --> 00:38:41,093
I told you.
No more answers.

668
00:38:42,268 --> 00:38:44,099
This is who I am now.

669
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:48,237
A guy on a train
with no answers.

670
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:50,502
I hope that can be
enough for you.

671
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:52,942
Michael, come on.

672
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:55,240
Running away from your
problems won't solve anything.

673
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:56,906
You know that.
I don't know that.

674
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:59,314
Your creditors can follow
you anywhere with ease.

675
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:02,218
Your debt follows you around
the world, electronically.

676
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:04,051
I'll stay off the grid.

677
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:05,613
Michael, come on.

678
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:08,956
Come on. You can deal with this.
It's not that bad.

679
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:11,428
Yeah, it is.

680
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:16,024
It is.
I really messed up.

681
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:19,231
Well...

682
00:39:20,906 --> 00:39:22,100
When...

683
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:25,943
When my life fell apart and
they screwed me in New York

684
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:29,572
and I felt like my whole world was
collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.

685
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:33,243
I mean, my whole family still won't even
talk to me on the advice of counsel,

686
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:36,982
and my friends were just
waiting for this to happen.

687
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:38,887
That's really
nice of you to say.

688
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:43,258
Michael, no. What I want to
say is you were there for me,

689
00:39:44,897 --> 00:39:46,262
by my side,

690
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:49,299
without even a thought.

691
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:52,537
That's just who you are.

692
00:39:56,675 --> 00:40:03,080
I mean, no matter
how badly I treat you

693
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:07,141
or what I'm going through, you just...
You are there for me,

694
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:10,746
and that is a guy
worth staying beside.

695
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:15,351
So where is this
train taking us?

696
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:20,954
I...

697
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,791
I think the engineer left.

698
00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:58,601
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute
calling from Dunder Mifflin,

699
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:02,971
and according to our records, you
appear to be low on office supplies.

700
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:05,943
Okay. Sure. Yeah. I can take
care of that right now.

701
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,214
Don't sell your
implants, please.

702
00:41:10,282 --> 00:41:12,614
I'm keeping them.
I know you like them.

703
00:41:16,188 --> 00:41:17,621
They're kind of
uncomfortable, though.

704
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,590
It's nice, though. Looks cute.
Kind of painful,

705
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:21,751
and my nipples aren't as sensitive now.
Looks cute, though.
