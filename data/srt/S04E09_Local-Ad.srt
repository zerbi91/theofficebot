1
00:00:00,248 --> 00:00:02,341
Yeah. Everything. It's all good.
It's all good. Phyllis.

2
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:03,441
Dancing babies.

3
00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:05,042
Dancing babies.
I love it. I love it.

4
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:08,247
We are making a commercial
for Dunder Mifflin today,

5
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:09,654
our first ad ever.

6
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:12,288
Corporate purchased some
airtime in local markets

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,157
to spread the word
about Dunder Mifflin Infinity,

8
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:17,721
and they are even sending up
a professional ad company

9
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:22,168
to help us make it later.
So it's not too shabby.

10
00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:24,261
Best ad ever?

11
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,433
Give me a break,
give me a break

12
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:29,806
Break me off
a piece of that

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,772
I am totally blanking.
What is the thing?

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,044
Nobody tell him.

15
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:38,813
What?
No. Why?

16
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,251
You got it.
You're so close.

17
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:42,312
Break me off
a piece of that

18
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:46,590
Applesauce

19
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:49,186
"Break me off a piece of that
applesauce." I don't think so.

20
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:51,061
A piece of that
Chrysler car

21
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:52,190
Nope.

22
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:53,427
Football cream

23
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,059
Okay.
It's football cream.

24
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:57,866
It's football cream. All
right, so, anybody else?

25
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:01,170
I'm taking a computer animation
class, so I can try to do a logo.

26
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:02,300
Look at that.

27
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:05,744
Even the receptionist is getting in on
the creativity. Very good. Very good.

28
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:07,107
Hello. Hello.

29
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:08,443
Hey. How you doing?
Michael Scott.

30
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:09,676
Hey, Michael.
Regional manager.

31
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,514
Hi, Michael. Nice to meet you.
Excited to talk ideas.

32
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:12,644
Us, too, man.
You know what,

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,951
I want this to be cutting edge.
I want it to be fast.

34
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:19,516
Quick cuts, you know?
Youthful, sort of a

35
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:20,856
MTV-on-crack
kind of thing.

36
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:21,952
That sounds great.

37
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,498
All right. Good. Well, this
is what we have to work with.

38
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:28,228
I would like you to meet
Andrew Bernard, the Nard Dog.

39
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:29,895
Who let
the Nard dog out?

40
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:33,597
He gives the best back
rubs in the office.

41
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:36,644
That's true, I give a mean back rub.
Also do good aromatherapy.

42
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,479
You just got
Nard-dogged!

43
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:45,747
Now, this gentleman right here
is the key to our urban vibe.

44
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:48,952
Urban? I grew up
in a small town.

45
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:51,218
What about me
seems urban to you?

46
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:52,418
Stanley is hilarious.

47
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:55,291
Phyllis is like
our Mrs. Butterworth.

48
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,456
Kind of a less
urban Aunt Jemima.

49
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,959
These are our accountants.

50
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:05,904
And as you can see, they
are very different sizes.

51
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:08,635
What you might
want to do is kind of

52
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,702
a Papa Bear, Mama Bear,
Baby Bear thing.

53
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:12,871
That might be
kind of fun.

54
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:14,073
Mama Bear.

55
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:15,137
Who else?

56
00:02:15,283 --> 00:02:17,581
I think it's great that the
company's making a commercial,

57
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:20,815
because not very many
people have heard of us.

58
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:23,186
I mean, when I tell people
that I work at Dunder Mifflin,

59
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:28,923
they think that we sell mufflers
or muffins or mittens or...

60
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:33,693
And frankly all of those sound better
than paper, so I let it slide.

61
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:13,972
You playing
that game again?

62
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:18,501
Second Life is not a game. It is a
multi-user virtual environment.

63
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,376
It doesn't have
points or scores.

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,109
It doesn't have
winners or losers.

65
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:23,582
Oh, it has losers.

66
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:26,753
I signed up for Second
Life about a year ago.

67
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:30,188
Back then, my life was so great that
I literally wanted a second one.

68
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:33,159
In my second life,
I was also a paper salesman

69
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:35,058
and I was also
named Dwight.

70
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:36,926
Absolutely everything
was the same.

71
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,427
Except I could fly.

72
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:43,567
Little girl in a field
holding a flower.

73
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:47,333
We zoom back to find
that she's in the desert

74
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:50,106
and the field
is an oasis.

75
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:52,169
We zoom
back further,

76
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:57,115
the desert is a sandbox in the
world's largest resort hotel.

77
00:03:57,185 --> 00:04:02,020
Zoom back further, the hotel
is actually the playground

78
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,020
of the world's
largest prison.

79
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,222
But we zoom back further...
Okay,

80
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:08,694
I can tell that your
time is valuable...

81
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:10,196
Actually,

82
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:12,491
I don't get paid by the hour
anymore, but thank you.

83
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,296
I get paid
by the year.

84
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:16,461
So... That all sounds
really, really ambitious.

85
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:17,799
Yeah. I know.

86
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:20,238
Why don't we show you what we
did with the Nashua branch?

87
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:21,297
Mmm...

88
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:23,035
Okay.

89
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,303
That's what Nashua
came up with?

90
00:04:56,377 --> 00:04:58,436
That sucks. Wow.

91
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,872
That's what we
came up with.

92
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:02,415
Well, we can do
better than that.

93
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:04,713
Well, the main part of the ad
has to stay the same, actually.

94
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:08,050
Yeah, it's the last five seconds
where we have some leeway.

95
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:11,014
The waving?

96
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:13,526
Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving.
That was just what they did.

97
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:15,357
You guys can
be clapping

98
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:18,364
or sitting, standing
outside, inside, whatever.

99
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,900
And this is where you
really get to be creative.

100
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,663
I need some advice. I've been spending a
lot of time making out with Angela lately.

101
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:30,335
We've been necking.
But only necking. Right?

102
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:34,677
Not actually
kissing our mouths.

103
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,649
Just neck on neck.

104
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:41,051
It's just like rubbinglnuzzling
our necks together.

105
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:44,489
It's hot. I'm not gonna lie to
you, but it's a little weird.

106
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,754
But you seem like
a guy with answers.

107
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:50,126
So how do I fast track
this, get to first base?

108
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,461
We cannot
talk about this,

109
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:57,195
because someone
might hear us.

110
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,336
We'll use code names.

111
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:06,379
Angela can stay the same, but
we'll change Andy to Dwight.

112
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:10,242
That's not
different enough.

113
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:12,612
Dwike?

114
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:18,184
You have a call
from Eddie Murphy.

115
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:24,489
Hello.

116
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:27,033
MICHAEL IMITATING EDDIE MURPHY Shrek.
Shrek. I'm a donkey.

117
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:28,534
I'm a donkey, Shrek.

118
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:33,234
I'm just kidding.
It's me. Hello, Ry.

119
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,868
What?
Okay, calm down.

120
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,274
I just have
a small problem.

121
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,074
I told you not to call
about small problems.

122
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:41,546
Yeah. Well, when I call
about big problems,

123
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:44,915
you don't like that either,
so make up your mind, kiddo.

124
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:50,891
Here is the deal, the ad guys that you
sent are locking me in a creative box

125
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,983
and sort of
ignoring my ideas.

126
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,994
That's good. They're creative.
You're not.

127
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,525
I'm creative, Ryan.

128
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,065
It's not part
of your job.

129
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,566
It's, like,
maybe you can cook,

130
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:03,126
but that doesn't mean you
should start a restaurant.

131
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:05,638
Well, actually I can't cook and
I am starting a restaurant,

132
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:07,333
Mike's Cereal Shack.

133
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,370
I'm thinking we'll have as many
varieties as you can buy in the store.

134
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,174
Okay. I'm not really
interested in that right now.

135
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:16,109
I'm delegating creativity
to creative professionals.

136
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:17,343
It's a different
skill set.

137
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,386
Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
Yeah!

138
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:21,421
But I'm good at managing
people who do sales.

139
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:24,754
Are you? I don't think you're
doing such a great job here,

140
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:27,225
suppressing ideas
and creativity.

141
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,987
All right, let me ask you this. Tell
me if you think this is creative.

142
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:32,657
When I was five,

143
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,261
I imagined that there was
such a thing as a unicorn.

144
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:42,241
And this was before I had even
heard of one or seen one.

145
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:46,109
I just drew
a picture of a horse

146
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,549
that could fly over rainbows and
had a huge spike in its head.

147
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,985
I was five,
five years old.

148
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,148
Couldn't even talk yet.

149
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:03,959
Hey, guys. You know what? We
cannot shoot this ad today.

150
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,296
Okay, when should we come back?

151
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,461
How about
never-hundred hours, sir?

152
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:11,632
Wait, we were
sent here to help...

153
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:13,367
I'm not gonna
argue with this guy.

154
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:14,601
Let's go.

155
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:15,937
Good luck, dude.
Hey, thanks.

156
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,238
Thank you.
Thank you.

157
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:18,778
Michael,
David Wallace.

158
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,212
What is this about
dismissing the ad people?

159
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:25,082
Yeah. I'm glad you called. Ryan
is being a little bitch again.

160
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:26,278
I'm on, Michael.

161
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:28,218
What's up,
my brother?

162
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:32,983
Listen, David, I would like
to do this ad in-house.

163
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,054
I want to use only the creativity that
we have right here in the office,

164
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:40,327
and I will send it to
you tomorrow morning.

165
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:43,700
Take a look at it. If you do not
think that it's ready to air,

166
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:46,331
send the ad agency
back down here

167
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:48,773
and we'll do it
on my dime.

168
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,542
This is weird.

169
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:54,706
I'm willing to stake
my entire reputation on it.

170
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,247
Okay. I'll see
you tomorrow.

171
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,513
Okay.
Okay.

172
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:05,248
And thus Michael Scott
sealed his own destiny.

173
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:09,418
In a good way.

174
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:15,063
Has anyone ever come up to you
and said, "You're not creative"?

175
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,028
Yes.

176
00:09:17,104 --> 00:09:19,766
Well, they're wrong.
You are creative.

177
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,775
You are damn creative,
each and every one of you.

178
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:25,073
You are so much
more creative

179
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:28,843
than all of the other dry, boring
morons that you work with.

180
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,517
Who are you talking to,
specifically?

181
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:35,246
I kind of know what it's
like to be in commercials.

182
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:38,758
My nickname in high school
used to be Kool-Aid Man.

183
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:43,395
When I was younger I always wanted
to be an actor in commercials,

184
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:45,398
then I realized
I had a brain.

185
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:49,602
I'm excited about doing the ad, but
I'm not really used to doing videos

186
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,638
with so many
people around.

187
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,699
We have three scenes
to film, big scenes.

188
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,936
We have a song to write,
so let's get cracking.

189
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,911
Kelly, I want you
to do makeup.

190
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:02,847
Oscar, I would like you to do
costume design, obviously.

191
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,384
Phyllis, I'd like you
to look around town

192
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:07,614
and see if we have any
celebrities in our local area.

193
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,619
Sue Grafton is at
the Steamtown Mall.

194
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:12,249
She's doing a book
signing right now.

195
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:14,123
Okay, okay. Phyllis, this
is what I want you to do.

196
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:17,255
I want you to go down to the mall.
I want you to get in line.

197
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:20,391
I want you to get her
to be in this commercial.

198
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:25,061
This would be a huge coup, people.
All right?

199
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,300
Do not take no for an answer.
Okay.

200
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:29,604
Does anyone actually know
what Sue Grafton looks like?

201
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,008
I mean is she hot, or...

202
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,739
She's crazy hot.

203
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:36,374
Well, then maybe we should just use
Angela and say she's Sue Grafton.

204
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,644
Would anyone notice?

205
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:38,742
That's not happening.

206
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,613
I find the mystery
genre disgusting.

207
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,754
I hate being titillated.

208
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:45,249
Bye, everyone.

209
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:46,588
Light it up, Phyllis.
Get her, Phyl.

210
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:58,738
Out of paper, out of stock

211
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:01,775
Those friendly faces
around the block

212
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:04,174
Break loose
from the chains

213
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,440
That are causing
you pain

214
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:09,710
Call Michael and Stanley,
Jim, Dwight, Creed

215
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:13,184
Call Andy and Kelly
For your business paper needs

216
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,653
Dunder Mifflin

217
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:16,383
The people person's
paper people

218
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:17,754
Dunder Mifflin

219
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,087
The people person's
paper people

220
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,424
Time out. Time out.
Time out. I thought...

221
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:26,193
I was under the impression that
this was going to be a rap.

222
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,560
What's rap?

223
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:30,129
Okay, Darryl, wow.

224
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:32,035
You need to learn a lot
about your own culture.

225
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:33,266
I'll make you a mix.

226
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,602
Great.

227
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:44,406
News flash. I got some juicy updates
on Operation F'allen Angel.

228
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,179
Remind me to
tell you later.

229
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,986
Hey.

230
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,824
No talk.
I'm animating.

231
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:58,262
Why don't we take a quick
10-second break from that

232
00:11:58,332 --> 00:12:00,197
so I can show you
what's going on here.

233
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:03,896
Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life.
He's on it all the time.

234
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:07,966
So much so that his little guy
here has created his own world.

235
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,703
It's called
Second Second Life

236
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:12,746
for those people who want to be
removed even further from reality.

237
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:14,110
Are you serious?
Yeah.

238
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:16,513
Oh, my God.
He's really in pain.

239
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:18,578
Who's that?

240
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:21,177
Oh, it's just my avatar guy.
Whatever.

241
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:23,223
He looks
a lot like you.

242
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,591
Yeah. How much time did
you spend on that?

243
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,958
Not much. It's just for
tracking Dwight, so...

244
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,089
Right. You're a sports
writer in Philadelphia?

245
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,492
Nice build, too.

246
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:36,258
Yep.

247
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:38,032
You have a guitar
slung on your back.

248
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,198
I did not know
you played guitar.

249
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,500
I...

250
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,204
Why don't we go back to the animation?
No, no, no.

251
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,009
I want to see more of Philly Jim.
No, show me how this...

252
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:49,208
I want Philly Jim.

253
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:50,511
Show me
how this works.

254
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:51,710
Oh, boy.

255
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:01,022
Out of paper,
out of stock

256
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:05,561
Those friendly faces
around the block

257
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,691
Break loose from the chains

258
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:10,293
That are causing you pain

259
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,430
Call Michael, Stanley,
Jim, Dwight and Creed

260
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:14,701
Call Andy and Kelly
for your business paper needs

261
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:17,107
Call Dunder Mifflin

262
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:19,577
People person's
paper people

263
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:21,511
Dunder Mifflin

264
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:22,742
It's the people
person's paper people

265
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:25,284
Stop, stop, stop.

266
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:28,419
This is not me. This is not...
It's not my music.

267
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:31,253
You're right. It's better than you.
It's us.

268
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:33,259
Dunder Mifflin

269
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:34,351
The people person's
paper people

270
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:36,521
No, no, no. I hate it!
I hate it.

271
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:41,934
I don't hate it. I just don't like
it at all, and it's terrible.

272
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:45,633
You're on your own, Mike.

273
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:48,266
Okay, you know what?
Hold on, hold on, Darryl.

274
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:49,900
You just said you hated it. No.

275
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:52,468
You said you hated it.
I said I hate the style.

276
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:55,811
Break me off a piece
of that lumber tar

277
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:57,347
Snickers bar

278
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:00,854
Okay. Wow. Wow.
This looks terrible.

279
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,479
Break me off a piece
of that Grey Poupon

280
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:05,150
Andy. Andy. This is a
pivotal scene in the ad.

281
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:07,557
And if we don't get this,
if we don't nail it,

282
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:10,028
we're gonna lose the whole
triumph of the moment.

283
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:14,966
The triumph of the will. Now, God, what?
What, Phyllis?

284
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:18,368
Well, I got in line
to buy Sue Grafton's book

285
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:19,770
and when it came
to my turn,

286
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,934
I asked her if she wanted to be in the
ad, and she said, "No, thank you."

287
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,001
But I wasn't supposed to
take no for an answer...

288
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,569
Attagirl.
...so I kept on asking,

289
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:30,447
and they finally threw me out of the
store in front of all my friends.

290
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:31,740
Okay.

291
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:36,120
Did you or did you
not get Sue Grafton?

292
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,081
No.

293
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,491
Oh, you're...

294
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:44,030
Can somebody give her a tissue?
Please?

295
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:49,664
I hope you're not killing yourself on
this, because I'm sure it's good enough

296
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:53,228
for Michael's ad that will
probably be seen by no one.

297
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:56,037
Maybe. But it's not
good enough for me yet.

298
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,044
Okay. Do you want me to stay?

299
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:00,546
No, no, you can go home.
I'm good.

300
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:04,677
Pam is staying late tonight
to achieve her dreams,

301
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,844
so I'm pretty
proud of her.

302
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:08,182
Unfortunately,
she was my ride home.

303
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,120
You coming?

304
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,619
I...

305
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,684
Piss or get
off the pot!

306
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:22,996
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

307
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,935
Good morning.

308
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:30,071
Yeah, I'm sorry. I looked
away for a second,

309
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:32,374
and Creed snatched
your hash browns.

310
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:33,936
Thank you.
You're welcome.

311
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:36,682
I worked until
about 2:45 a.m.,

312
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,277
and then I had to decide if I wanted
to spend the night with Michael

313
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:44,723
editing in his office and Dwight
watching Michael edit in his office,

314
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,157
or drive home and probably
fall asleep at the wheel

315
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:48,592
and die in
a fiery car wreck.

316
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:51,826
I passed out on my
keyboard trying to decide.

317
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,232
Let me pour
you some bubbly,

318
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:58,829
because somebody got to a
whole new level last night.

319
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:00,396
Andy, I can't hear
this right now.

320
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:02,271
No. No. No.
This is good.

321
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:03,832
You know how we haven't
really gotten anywhere

322
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:06,106
that I want to get
to physically yet?

323
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,411
Well, last night,
that changed.

324
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:12,919
We're making out. I'm kissing
her neck and her cheek

325
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:16,547
and her ear lobe, and she's
not really kissing me back,

326
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:20,286
but she closes her
eyes and she's like,

327
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,420
"Oh, D. Oh, D."

328
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,229
She called you D?

329
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:31,330
Yeah.
D for Andy.

330
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,534
Oh, D.

331
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:36,836
Oh, D.

332
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,775
Oh, D.

333
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:41,143
Oh, D.

334
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,376
Oh, D!
Oh, D!

335
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:49,055
Oh, D!
Oh, D!

336
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:56,224
I'm about to send the ad to corporate.
And it is sent.

337
00:16:58,065 --> 00:17:01,057
They'll probably watch it right away.
I would.

338
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,527
Okay.

339
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:10,375
Yes? Pam, please clear
my phone lines.

340
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:11,604
Certainly.

341
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:16,948
Okay, clear.

342
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,276
They could call
any second now.

343
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:25,322
Oh, God.

344
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,490
I better call.

345
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,366
Well, it's been tough.

346
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:44,638
The geniuses at corporate
rejected my commercial,

347
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:47,145
and tonight they are airing
the brain-dead version.

348
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:49,273
So welcome
one and all

349
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:52,550
to the world premiere
of corporate crap fest.

350
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:13,598
Hey, seemed
like a big hit.

351
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,107
No.
People are stupid.

352
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:19,339
People like waving.
Waving sells, not art.

353
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:23,813
The ad we made, our ad,
the real one,

354
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:29,379
was full of humor and full of depth
and full of heart, and it was real.

355
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:34,725
Hey, could you do me a favor? Could
you put that in the DVD player?

356
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,695
Hey, everybody, I just
want to welcome you all

357
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:40,665
to the premiere of the real
Dunder Mifflin commercial.

358
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:44,226
The Michael Scott director's cut.
Hope you like it.

359
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,233
It all starts
with an idea.

360
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:53,703
But you can never tell
where an idea will end up.

361
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,616
Because ideas spread.

362
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:02,818
They change, grow.

363
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,822
They connect us
with the world.

364
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:15,530
And in a fast-moving world,

365
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:18,469
where good news moves
at the speed of time,

366
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:28,038
and bad news isn't
always what it seems.

367
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:42,327
Because when push
comes to shove,

368
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,798
we all deserve
a second chance

369
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:56,671
to score.

370
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:08,047
Dunder Mifflin. Limitless
paper in a paperless world.

371
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:22,164
Animation, all her, by the way.
Really?

372
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, I just thought...
The animation was cool.

373
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:25,229
Thanks.

374
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:27,899
Hey, listen, you ever been
on a motorcycle because...

375
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,839
Michael, that was fun.

376
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,177
That was fun.

377
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,006
Next round of drinks
is on me, people.

378
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,248
Claude Van Damme

379
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:45,491
Hair for men

380
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,020
Poison gas, NutraSweet

381
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:50,656
It's got to rhyme
with "piece."

382
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:52,061
F'ancy F'east.

383
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:54,862
Break me off a piece
of that Fancy Feast

384
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,797
It's the cat food.
Nailed it.
