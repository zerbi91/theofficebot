1
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:04,613
This is ridiculous.

2
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:07,086
Do you have any idea what
time we'll get out of here?

3
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:10,318
Nobody likes to work late,
least of all me.

4
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:13,417
Do you have
plans tonight?

5
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:14,553
No, I don't.

6
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:17,223
Remember when you told us not to
make plans, 'cause we were working?

7
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:18,890
Yes, I remember.

8
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,793
Hmm.

9
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:23,804
This is BS. This is BS.
Why are we here?

10
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:27,397
I am gonna call corporate.
Enough is enough. I'm...

11
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:31,673
God, I'm so mad! This is
Michael Scott, Scranton.

12
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:34,873
Well, we don't want to work.
No, we don't!

13
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:37,509
It's not fair
to these people!

14
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:41,043
These people are my friends,
and I care about them!

15
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:42,714
We're not gonna do it!

16
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:47,288
Everybody, I just got off
the horn with corporate,

17
00:00:47,362 --> 00:00:52,299
and basically I told them where they could
stick their little overtime assignment.

18
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:53,959
Go enjoy your F'riday.
Thank you, Michael.

19
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:55,195
All right.

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,294
All right.
Happy F'riday.

21
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,464
Well, I think we dodged a bullet, there.
I think you did.

22
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:00,006
I think we should
celebrate.

23
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:03,304
How about you, Pam, mi casa. A
little dinner, dancing, drinks?

24
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:06,176
Oh, I... You said you
didn't have plans.

25
00:01:07,982 --> 00:01:09,745
That's what you said.

26
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:13,913
Michael has asked Pam and me
to dinner at least nine times.

27
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:16,855
And every time, we've been
able to get out of it.

28
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:20,588
But I've got to give him credit.
He got me.

29
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:23,028
Because I'm starting
to suspect

30
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:25,565
that there was no
assignment from corporate.

31
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,601
Michael, what time
should I be arriving?

32
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:30,002
Dwight, it's couples only.

33
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:35,270
And besides, I only have six wine glasses.
So it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim.

34
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:37,174
And Angela
and Andy.

35
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:38,644
Hey, oh!

36
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:44,010
Does it bother me that I wasn't
invited to Michael's dinner party?

37
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,653
- Hi.
- Hello.

38
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,752
How are you?
Come on in.

39
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,820
Good to see you.
Chilly, huh?

40
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:31,694
I'm so glad
we finally...

41
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:32,788
F'inally got to do this
with you guys.

42
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,767
This is great.

43
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,400
You want to take
their coats, babe?

44
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:38,666
Yes, I would.
Okay.

45
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,107
All right. So, what
have you been doing?

46
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:44,167
Let's see, since I saw
you an hour ago? Yeah!

47
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:46,907
I have been getting ready,
and then driving over here.

48
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,040
Well, we've been doing
pretty much the same thing.

49
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,017
Really?
Except driving.

50
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:54,052
We got you this.

51
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:55,315
Pam!

52
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,482
Thank you. That's so nice.
Thanks.

53
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:58,252
This will be great
to cook with. Really.

54
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:01,159
Well, have a seat,
or come on in, or...

55
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:04,995
I don't know, make yourself
to home. This is our casa.

56
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,192
- It's really nice.
- It's great.

57
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:07,894
So, what do you guys think?
Should we do the tour first,

58
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,527
should we have
appetizers first?

59
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,629
Tour. Let's do the tour first.
Okay.

60
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,674
You have a preference,
babe? Upstairs first?

61
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:16,141
Totally your call, babe. All
right, well, let's go, then.

62
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,075
All right.
I say upstairs.

63
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,745
You guys doing
a little construction?

64
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,079
Oh, just redoing
the sliding glass door.

65
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:29,420
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet.
We are still a work in progress, here.

66
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,458
This is my office.

67
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,289
Yup. Never been used.

68
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,022
Not super-exciting.
No.

69
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:37,360
And this is my work space.
This is it.

70
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:38,557
Check that out.
You smell that?

71
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:39,691
Uh-huh.

72
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:43,168
As you can smell, there's a lot of
different odors going on in here.

73
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:45,199
So you have an office
and a work space.

74
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:48,800
I do, you know. I just... I
cannot create in the same space

75
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:52,141
that I conduct business. I'm sure that
you're the same with your doodles.

76
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:53,237
Smell.

77
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,483
It's fire.
Bonfire.

78
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:57,848
Bond!
Men love this one.

79
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,447
James Bond-fire! "I am
Bond-fire... James Bond-fire."

80
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:03,990
Michael Scott!

81
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,761
When I get frustrated,
or irritated or...

82
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,765
Angry, I come up here and I
just smell all my candles!

83
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,028
And it just... Poof!
Goes away.

84
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:15,330
Just like that.
Just like that.

85
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,870
So this is the
master bedroom.

86
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,031
And these walls, they used to be,
like, white, like an asylum.

87
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,976
So I wanted it to be softer, so I
had it painted an eggshell white.

88
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:27,708
Guess what? White and eggshell
white are exactly the same color.

89
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:29,813
Babe...
Exactly.

90
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,782
I thought you said that you
were gonna tidy things up.

91
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,286
Well, I...

92
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:34,446
Shame on you.

93
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,748
What a cute bench.

94
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,418
Thanks.
That's my bed.

95
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:44,261
Jan has some space issues,
so I curl up on that puppy.

96
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,597
Really? 'Cause... It seems
pretty narrow and short.

97
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:51,968
It's actually a lot bigger than it seems.
Look at this!

98
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:53,973
See?
He fits perfectly.

99
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,269
I finally

100
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,076
broke down
and bought myself

101
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,313
a plasma TV.

102
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,719
Check it out. I actually hung
this on the wall myself.

103
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,849
That's good. I want to
show you something.

104
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:13,792
A lot of people in the room,
you need more space...

105
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,829
Voilà.
Right into the wall.

106
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:16,921
Wow!

107
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:18,659
Sometimes, I will just

108
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:22,134
stand here and watch television
for hours. I love it.

109
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:27,071
I love this TV. And I
also built this table.

110
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:28,972
What is that,
chestnut?

111
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:31,136
No, I think that is either
pine or Nordic cherry.

112
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:32,270
It's pine. Yeah.

113
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:34,610
Michael, I'm just terrible at all
this stuff, so that's really cool.

114
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,115
- Really?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:40,814
Yeah, he tried to set up my TiVo for me,
but then I didn't have audio for a week.

116
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:44,119
If you ever need any help,
I'm just a phone call away.

117
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:45,386
I bet you are.

118
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,418
Well, I saw...

119
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:49,656
Oh, your Dundies.

120
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,324
I'm surprised they're not out on the
coffee table for everybody to see.

121
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:57,632
Well, it was between the neon
beer sign and the Dundies.

122
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,832
So I said, "Honey,
keep the trophies."

123
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:05,573
Oh, honey, I have the best trophy
right here. Aside from my Dundies.

124
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:10,106
Oh, excuse us for just a second.
I'll get it.

125
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:12,243
So glad we were finally
able to do this.

126
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,047
So glad we...
No. No.

127
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:16,248
Okay.
Tuna!

128
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:19,225
What's up, Tuna? We gonna
have some tuna for dinner?

129
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,955
I bet you're sick of tuna, right?
You probably have tuna every night.

130
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,259
All right.
Tuna.

131
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,698
These are for you.
Oh, how thoughtful.

132
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,201
Very nice.
Except for one flower,

133
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,761
which is for my flower.

134
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,828
Aw.

135
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,838
What am I supposed
to do with this?

136
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,879
Well, how about we do the short
tour, and then I'll start dinner?

137
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,642
Oh, I can help starting
dinner, if you need it.

138
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:44,776
Oh no, no, no, it's just the Osso Buco,
needs to braise for about three hours.

139
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:46,683
Everything else
is done.

140
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:50,383
Three hours from now, or three
hours from earlier, like 4:00?

141
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:54,554
You know, Pam, in Spain, they often
don't even start eating until midnight.

142
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:56,688
When in Rome.

143
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,561
You have a preference?
Upstairs first?

144
00:06:58,633 --> 00:06:59,657
Whatever
you say, babe.

145
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:00,723
F'ollow me.

146
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:01,893
All right.

147
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:08,602
How about a toast? Shall I?
Here's to good friends.

148
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:10,405
Cheers.
Cheers.

149
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:13,572
Mmm.

150
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:17,284
A sort of an
oaky afterbirth.

151
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:20,077
What was that?

152
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:22,554
Music? Should we turn
some music on?

153
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,352
That sounds good.

154
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:27,986
Do you guys remember
my old assistant, Hunter?

155
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:32,658
He is an excellent songwriter. Wait
until you hear this. Okay, here we go.

156
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:12,371
You know what? Hunter was
a terrible assistant.

157
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,566
That is why
Ryan fired him.

158
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,666
Well, I think he's probably
just about as reliable as Pam,

159
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:18,303
being that it usually takes you
an afternoon to get back to me.

160
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:21,143
Sometimes I think
she holds on to faxes.

161
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:27,285
I don't care what they say about me.
I just want to eat.

162
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:30,290
Which I realize
is a lot to ask for

163
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,053
at a dinner party.

164
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,823
Cow. No, it's a hump,
there's a hump.

165
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:37,089
Joe Camel! Joe Camel! Yes!

166
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:39,428
Okay, yes. F'irst
name of that animal,

167
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,300
and the second name is the state
where Helena is the capital.

168
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:44,998
Montana.
Joe Montana?

169
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:46,801
Yes! Yes!

170
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,808
Time's up! All
right, two pieces!

171
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:50,536
Why didn't you just say
49ers quarterback?

172
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:55,377
All right, my... my... my... my turn!
My... my... my... my turn!

173
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:57,144
My... my... my... my turn!

174
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:59,209
Babe, can you just, like, really...
What?

175
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:01,082
You're just, like, really...

176
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:02,520
What? What?

177
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,182
Could you just simmer down?
Seriously.

178
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:06,192
I'm just making people laugh.
No.

179
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,888
Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
I was watching Jim.

180
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,988
And he was laughing.

181
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:12,358
No smile.

182
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,697
Look at him.
He's laughing.

183
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:18,738
Michael and Jan seem to be
playing their own separate game.

184
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:22,606
And it's called, "Let's see how
uncomfortable we can make our guests."

185
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:26,511
And they're both winning. So I
am going to make a run for it.

186
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:30,511
You'll never guess. I just got
a message from my landlord.

187
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:32,211
Apparently,
my apartment flooded.

188
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:33,981
Something with the sprinkler.
Oh, no!

189
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:36,649
Pam, we should probably get
going and see the damage.

190
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:37,748
Oh! Okay.

191
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:40,157
Well, you don't need
two of you to do that.

192
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,226
That's true...

193
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,226
Dinner sounded
delicious.

194
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:49,030
Pam, I'll see you at home.
Thank you so much.

195
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:52,436
Oh, Jim, I don't think you're going to
abandon this party here, all by itself.

196
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,403
I don't know, because
everything I own is there.

197
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:57,569
You can buy new stuff, but
you can't buy a new party.

198
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:01,206
That's true. That is a great point.
Come on down here.

199
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:07,349
Sit down on that couch
and be amongst friends,

200
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:10,913
and we're not gonna think about all
your stuff being destroyed. All right?

201
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:12,083
Michael, you're up.

202
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,820
Here we go.
This is gonna be fun.

203
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,020
- Ready...
- Go!

204
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,064
All right.
F'irst name is Tom.

205
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:20,396
No, no, no. No names. No names,
no rhyming, no sound-alikes.

206
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:22,834
All right, okay. Okay.
You're getting into my head!

207
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:24,768
F'irst name is blank,
and he goes on a cruise.

208
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,864
He goes on
a Caribbean cruise.

209
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:28,169
I don't know.
Katie Holmes.

210
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:31,370
No, but he's married to her!
Oh, Dawson's Creek.

211
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:34,278
No, it has to be a real person, Jim.
Come on!

212
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:37,010
No, no, I'm gonna pass.
I'm gonna pass.

213
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:39,178
Okay!

214
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:42,381
Rhymes with Parnold Sportsanegger.
No rhyming!

215
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:43,889
Not really a rhyme.

216
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,255
Another clue!
Another clue!

217
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:47,624
Okay, he's the governor
of California.

218
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:49,162
He is the Terminator.

219
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,720
Those aren't helpful.
Tom Cruise!

220
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:51,856
No!
Time!

221
00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:54,696
God! Does anybody
read the paper?

222
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:05,638
Oh, thank you.

223
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:06,771
You're welcome.

224
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:21,021
I'm so, so sorry for the
temperature in here.

225
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:25,824
The sliding glass
door shattered.

226
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,333
So...
It's okay.

227
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,332
It's actually
a really cute story.

228
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:33,373
Do you want to tell it,
babe, or should I tell it?

229
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,464
I don't like
that story, babe.

230
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,566
Come on!

231
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:39,875
It's a cute story... Michael ran
through the sliding glass door

232
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:42,939
because he thought he heard
the ice cream truck.

233
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,348
Stop. Stop it!

234
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:47,454
I mean, I like ice cream,
okay? Sue me.

235
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:49,887
Oh, no, don't.

236
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:52,687
I shouldn't say that jokingly,
because she will sue me.

237
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,696
She loves to sue.
She loves lawsuits.

238
00:11:56,764 --> 00:12:01,724
You know, honey, that door was extremely
clean, and it looked invisible.

239
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:03,702
You are so right.
You are so right!

240
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:07,036
Because before I lived here, the
glass was always covered in smudges.

241
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:10,304
And I moved in and I cleaned it, so
I guess that makes me the devil.

242
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:15,909
You are! She is! She is the devil!
I'm in hell!

243
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,248
I'm burning.
Help me!

244
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,650
You shouldn't
joke about that.

245
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,982
Is there more wine
in the kitchen?

246
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,420
No, I will get it.
I will get it.

247
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:24,320
What kind of hostess would I
be if I didn't get my wine?

248
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:26,655
It's okay, I don't mind. No, no, no.
In fact, you know what?

249
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:29,594
Girls' trip. Angela,
come on. Girls' trip.

250
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,626
Oh, not even close.

251
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:36,863
So, you keep
a very tidy house.

252
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:40,031
You should see our bathroom
after Michael takes a bath.

253
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,510
But I don't have
to tell you, Pam.

254
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:45,340
Oh, yeah...

255
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:46,504
What?

256
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,277
Oh, don't tell me that he's really
changed since you guys dated.

257
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:51,682
Oh, are you joking?

258
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:55,882
No, Michael told me a little bit about
it, but I see the way you look at him.

259
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,288
I have never, ever dated

260
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:02,728
or wanted to do anything
resembling dating Michael, ever.

261
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:07,062
Not ever, not now, not then,
not now, not ever, ever.

262
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:09,193
I've noticed how you look
at him at the office.

263
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,259
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:18,709
So, I spend most of my time right here.
Have a hand.

265
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,247
So, Jim, I noticed you
checking out Jan's candles.

266
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,306
Oh, no, she just put it
in front of my face.

267
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:26,444
Yeah, did you know
that candles

268
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,422
are the number-one fastest-growing
product in the scent-aroma market?

269
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:34,552
$2 billion a year industry.
And for only $10,000,

270
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:38,428
you could become a co-owner
of "Serenity by Jan."

271
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,161
What do you think about that?
Thought about it. I'm in.

272
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:45,535
I'm sorry, are you really trying to
get us to invest in Jan's company?

273
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:47,399
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:50,636
What now?

275
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:53,111
Coming.

276
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:55,414
Hello.

277
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:56,915
What are you
doing here?

278
00:13:56,984 --> 00:14:00,579
We came here to eat dinner and to party.
This is a dinner party, right?

279
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:02,315
Awesome!
What is he doing here?

280
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:03,786
Yes, what are
you doing here?

281
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:05,381
Dwight is my friend.

282
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,257
We weren't invited?

283
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:13,130
You said that I could not invite Dwight
because he was not part of a couple,

284
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,135
and because we didn't have
enough wine glasses.

285
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:19,399
Dwight brought glasses
and a person.

286
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,134
F'ine.
Whatever you want.

287
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,766
Just like always.
Whatever you want.

288
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:25,368
Whatever I want?
It's never whatever I want.

289
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:28,608
It's fine, Michael. When
I wanted to see Stomp

290
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:29,774
and you wanted
to see Wicked,

291
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,613
what did we see?
We saw Wicked...

292
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:34,552
When I said that
I wanted to have kids,

293
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:38,284
and you said that you wanted me to
have a vasectomy, what did I do?

294
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,827
And then, when you said that
you might want to have kids,

295
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:43,829
and I wasn't so sure, who
had the vasectomy reversed?

296
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:45,888
And then when you said you
definitely didn't want to have kids?

297
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,297
Who had it reversed back?

298
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:49,495
Snip, snap! Snip, snap!
Snip, snap!

299
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,764
I did!
Okay...

300
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:56,037
You have no idea the physical toll that
three vasectomies have on a person!

301
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:59,311
And I bought this condo

302
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,813
to fill with children.

303
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,246
I am so sorry

304
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:05,513
that I don't want to bring kids
into this screwed-up world.

305
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,019
Okay? But look...
I'm sorry, too.

306
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:11,387
- If you want to have kids, then fine, you win.
- Let's have a kid!

307
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:16,689
Do you mean it?
You want to have a kid?

308
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:19,629
I hate my life.

309
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:22,763
So, can we come in?

310
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:31,470
Mmm.

311
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,780
Great turkey leg.

312
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:37,777
Okay, I'm just gonna
check on dinner.

313
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,382
Angela, would you like
some of my beet salad?

314
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:44,924
I hate beet salad.

315
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:46,516
It's actually
really good.

316
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:48,458
Hey, hey, hey.

317
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:51,555
I know you love beet salad. I've
seen you eat it many times.

318
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:56,865
The thought of popping one of your beets
into my mouth makes me want to vomit.

319
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:57,926
Pam...

320
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,707
I hope she didn't
do anything to the food.

321
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:04,703
Like what?

322
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:06,746
I can't prove it,

323
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:09,783
but I think she might
be trying to poison me.

324
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:16,048
Hey,
looks great, babe.

325
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:17,317
Yeah,
it really does.

326
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:20,656
I know Jan didn't poison the food.
I know that.

327
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:23,958
But if she was going to poison the
food of someone at that table,

328
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:27,228
wouldn't it be me?
Michael's former lover.

329
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,570
Can you not do that?
It's disgusting.

330
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,214
You know I have soft teeth.
How could you say that?

331
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:43,508
Oops.

332
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:48,020
Excuse me
for a second.

333
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:56,355
So, how do you guys
know each other?

334
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:59,321
I was his babysitter.

335
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,163
And now you guys
are dating?

336
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:05,171
Purely carnal, that's
all you need to know.

337
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:08,299
Would you write down your e-mail?
Because I have, just,

338
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,434
so many questions.
E-mail?

339
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,776
Never mind.
Okay.

340
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,284
All right.
There we go.

341
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:27,582
There.

342
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:32,254
Okay.

343
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:34,766
That's nice. Everybody
enjoying their meal?

344
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:38,568
- Hey, babe.
- Yeah.

345
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:41,005
How about we take the beer sign
down until our guests leave,

346
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:42,132
and then we can
discuss it?

347
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:46,839
No, no. I'm gonna leave it up. I think
it ties the whole room together.

348
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:49,241
Okay.

349
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:58,281
Jan thinks Hunter's
very talented.

350
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:01,418
You know what? I don't
think he's that good.

351
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:03,122
At least he's an artist.

352
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:05,427
BF'D, I'm a screenwriter.

353
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:08,660
And I'm a candle maker, but you
don't hear me bragging about it!

354
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:13,569
No, all you do is you get me to
try to work on my rich friends.

355
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,733
F'or an investment
opportunity!

356
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:18,334
Man, I would love
to burn your candles!

357
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:19,970
You burn it,
you buy it!

358
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:22,675
Oh, good, I'll be
your first customer!

359
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:24,580
You're hardly my first.

360
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:26,118
That's what she said!

361
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:41,691
That is a $200 plasma screen
TV that you just killed!

362
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:44,134
Good luck
paying me back

363
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:48,072
on your zero-dollars-a-year
salary plus benefits, babe!

364
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,242
I'm gonna get going.

365
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:57,510
F'ine, get out of here.

366
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:58,915
It's getting late.
We should...

367
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:02,649
You know what, you guys? She'll
be out of the bathroom soon.

368
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:03,747
Of course.

369
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:06,418
Get out of my way.
I'll take care of this.

370
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,461
Okay, what seems to be
the problem, Officers?

371
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:10,928
Not now, Dwight. We got a
call about a disturbance.

372
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:13,762
No. Nope.
Nothing disturbing here.

373
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:16,564
Just a couple of friends having
an awesome dinner party.

374
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:18,261
Your neighbors say
they heard some shouting.

375
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:20,704
Yes, there was
screaming, but...

376
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:26,307
My girlfriend threw a Dundie
at my TV, plasma.

377
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:28,306
You want to
press charges?

378
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:29,849
Would she get
into trouble?

379
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,383
Yeah, she'd
be charged.

380
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:35,344
I will take the fall.
I did it.

381
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:39,552
You know, you don't have to press charges.
You could just try to be more quiet.

382
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:41,685
Michael!
Yes.

383
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,525
Wait, what are
you doing to him?

384
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,588
Sir, do you have any other
place you could stay?

385
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,499
Maybe with one
of your friends, here?

386
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:51,566
Michael can come
home with me.

387
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:54,397
Jim, Pam?

388
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:56,032
Oh, my apartment's
on fire.

389
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,303
F'looded.
F'looded.

390
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:58,366
You people!

391
00:19:58,445 --> 00:20:00,174
Come on, you're sleeping with me.
No.

392
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:02,078
I'm gonna take you home, Michael.
No.

393
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,479
All right.

394
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:06,814
Bye, babe!

395
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:09,615
This is the best burger
I've ever had, babe.

396
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,753
Babe, I should have told you, but...
I did something bad.

397
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:21,092
I stole this.
F'or you, babe.

398
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:39,579
One night

399
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,086
I love that.
