1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,221
W.B. Jones is renovating their
offices, and their construction crews

2
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,985
are taking up some of the
parking spaces we used to get.

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,823
So we had to park at a satellite
parking lot over there.

4
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:17,556
Which just means we get to see
more of our lovely street.

5
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:19,189
Tell them what
we saw today, Jim.

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:24,270
Oh, today we saw a junkyard dog attacking
the bones of a rotisserie chicken.

7
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:25,464
Nature.

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,899
I've been here
nine years,

9
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:29,067
now all of a sudden I'm supposed
to park half a mile away.

10
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:33,102
I lost a penny out
of my loafers, Oscar.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,738
I will quit.

12
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:38,717
As God is my witness, I will
quit if this is not fixed.

13
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:41,184
Some of us like the walk
more than others.

14
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:43,280
It hurts like hell.

15
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:11,075
Did you pick a new chair?
It's been a while.

16
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:14,120
Pam, when I first
opened this catalogue,

17
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:16,656
I thought I was just going
to be picking out a chair.

18
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,181
But instead you found something to distract
you from ever picking out a chair.

19
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,956
Michael started the process of selecting
a new chair about three weeks ago.

20
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:26,793
And normally I wouldn't care,
but he promised me his old one.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,993
It's way better.
It's one of these.

22
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:32,366
I really want it.

23
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:35,664
Have you ever
seen this woman?

24
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:36,902
Her?

25
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:40,276
The one in the really great mesh,
black, high-back swivel chair?

26
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:44,374
Look at her smile. It's the eyes.
Look at her eyes. She's got...

27
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:48,945
I don't know what it is, exactly.
She dresses like a professional,

28
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:54,187
and yet you know there is a side of her
that could just curl up on a couch.

29
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,626
Or in a great chair.

30
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,721
Yeah, maybe, but...

31
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:03,231
Remember, after my dinner party, when
I said that I was swearing off women?

32
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:05,271
I definitely remember
your dinner party.

33
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:08,672
I think what I meant was that I am
completely swearing off one woman.

34
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:10,868
Jan.

35
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:15,573
I think that fate put this
catalogue in my hands.

36
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,948
Actually, I put the catalogue in your hand,
'cause you have to pick out a new chair.

37
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,979
What is it like being single?
I like it. I like

38
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:28,251
starting each day with a
sense of possibility.

39
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,852
And I'm optimistic,

40
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,990
because every day I get a
little more desperate,

41
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,566
and kindly turn
to Page 85?

42
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,344
Yo, is this
his new chair?

43
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:48,904
No, he hasn't
picked one yet.

44
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:50,142
God!

45
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:53,778
When Pam gets Michael's old
chair, I get Pam's old chair.

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,583
Then I'll have two chairs.
Only one to go.

47
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:02,756
I am ready to start dating again.
I'm getting back on the market.

48
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:07,857
So, F'YI, for those of you who're
thinking about fixing me up

49
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:09,663
with any of your friends,

50
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:13,069
use the woman
on Page 85

51
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,835
as a template.

52
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,569
That will be all.

53
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:26,577
I left my cell phone
in my car.

54
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,852
Call us when you get there,
so we know you're okay.

55
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:38,094
Listen, man, I am
completely over Jan.

56
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:41,498
So, would you
set me up?

57
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:46,198
If I had somebody to set you up with,
Michael, then I'd take her for myself.

58
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:47,331
I thought you
were engaged.

59
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:50,001
Nope. Stacy broke up
with me.

60
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:54,510
What? God,
that's terrible, man.

61
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,414
She's crazy.

62
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,483
Are you still on good terms
with any of her friends?

63
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:03,648
Not anymore.
It's a bitter situation.

64
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:08,719
She's...
You don't deserve her.

65
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:10,154
All right.

66
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,329
Hello, Oscar Mayer
Weiner lover.

67
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:20,471
I bet that you have a bunch of
very liberal girl-type friends

68
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,638
who trust you implicitly,

69
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,507
because they know you'd never touch
'em because of your condition.

70
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,144
Michael?
What?

71
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:30,445
I have a friend who's single.
Oh.

72
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,643
Sandy.

73
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:36,087
She's gorgeous, and she's got
a feisty personality, too.

74
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:41,719
F'eisty? So she's not jolly or sassy?
Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?

75
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,059
No, she's a professional
softball player.

76
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,258
Catcher or infield?

77
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,631
I don't know, Michael.

78
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:53,500
Is she a dress-wearer
or a pants-wearer?

79
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:57,031
Could we share a rowboat?
Could a rowboat support her?

80
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,134
What are you asking?

81
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,475
I think I'm being very
clear what I'm asking.

82
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:04,347
Would an average-sized rowboat
support her without capsizing?

83
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,248
It bothers me that you're
not answering the question.

84
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:12,655
No, all right? No,
she can't fit in a rowboat.

85
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,853
Damn it! I knew it!
I knew it, Phyllis! Okay.

86
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:18,121
What is wrong with these people?
I would do anything for them,

87
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,961
and they're just
hanging me out to dry.

88
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,091
Dating shouldn't be hard
for somebody like me,

89
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,106
but it is, and you know why? Because
nobody here is willing to help me.

90
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:32,373
Nothing would ever get done in this office
without a formal request, would it?

91
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:34,776
Well, fine.
Here goes.

92
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,110
I don't think that this is...
Now, okay,

93
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:39,084
I know that this is
probably not appropriate.

94
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,582
But I need help.

95
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:49,385
Because I want to play ball with
my kids before I get too old.

96
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:53,394
And before that happens,
I need to get laid.

97
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,933
And before that happens,
I need to be in love.

98
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:01,473
And I don't wanna hear, "I
don't know, I can't help..."

99
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,942
No, no. I am a catch,
and I am not going to be

100
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:06,273
the one who got away.

101
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,712
So this is what
we're going to do.

102
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:13,949
Dwight is going to hand out index cards,
and I want you all to write down the name

103
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:17,990
of an eligible woman for me to
date by the end of the day.

104
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,492
No, by the end of the hour,
or you are fired.

105
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:26,832
Write legibly, people.

106
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:33,501
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones,
half of us have to park in the satellite lot.

107
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,472
It's, like, a ten-minute walk.
No, 30.

108
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:39,238
Well, look, I have an assigned
parking place in front, so...

109
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,211
All right, all right,
all right.

110
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:46,275
Let me try to think about what it
would be like to not have one.

111
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:55,556
Okay, yes, that would be bad.
Yes!

112
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,722
That would be bad.
Okay, so...

113
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,565
Help us out. Wish I
could, but I can't.

114
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,363
Well, can, but won't.

115
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:04,834
Should, maybe,
but, shorn't.

116
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:06,099
Michael, please...

117
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,834
What part of "shorn't" don't
you understand, Kevin?

118
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:11,742
Look, I could probably
handle it, yes, but...

119
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:14,607
I think it would be a good exercise
for you guys to do it yourselves.

120
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:16,908
We won't let you down. You
can't, because I don't care.

121
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,147
Listen! Don't forget to fill out
those cards. My love cards.

122
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:26,722
There's nobody I hate enough to
write her name on this card.

123
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:30,058
Well, I'm setting Michael up
with my fat friend, anyway.

124
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,961
He can just
deal with it.

125
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,158
Who are you
putting down?

126
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,495
Oh, you don't know her.

127
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:36,661
Who is it?
Your mom.

128
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:38,294
Yeah, whatever.

129
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,604
Give that to me!
Give that to me.

130
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,767
Okay, Wendy.

131
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,071
Hot and juicy redhead.

132
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,304
Let's give this a try.

133
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:56,617
Wendy's.

134
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,453
Hello, Wendy.

135
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,891
This is Kevin's friend,
Michael.

136
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,826
This isn't Wendy.

137
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,693
I'm sorry. Could you
put her on, please?

138
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,823
Dude, this is a
Wendy's restaurant.

139
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:10,327
Damn it, Kevin. Okay...

140
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:11,392
Um...

141
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,130
Could I just have a F'rosty
and a baked potato, please?

142
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,971
You have to come to the
restaurant to order food.

143
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,136
Well, I'll send somebody to
pick it up, just have it ready.

144
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:20,611
It's ready now.

145
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,772
Well, put it aside.

146
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,274
Um...

147
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,052
I've collected the rest
of the ladies.

148
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,417
Good, good.

149
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:30,614
Because this batch
was awful.

150
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:32,988
This one says
"chair model"?

151
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,424
I wrote that.

152
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:39,591
Michael, you shouldn't have to settle.
This is my pledge to you.

153
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,829
I will find her, and I
will bring her to you.

154
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:46,235
And as God is my witness,
she shall bear your fruit.

155
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:51,674
That sounds good.
Go get her.

156
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:53,704
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!

157
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,375
F'irst, go to Wendy's, get my
food, come back, and then go.

158
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:00,686
That is fantastic.

159
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:04,121
Thank you, thank you very much.
This is just what I needed.

160
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:07,588
The furniture company gave me the
name of the advertising agency.

161
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,388
They gave me the name
of the photographer.

162
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:13,728
The photographer, a Spaniard, used
a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency.

163
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,530
The agency gave me
the following information.

164
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:19,663
Deborah Shoshlefski,
142 South Windsor Lane.

165
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,105
Dead, car accident.
Case closed.

166
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,837
She's dead?

167
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:29,708
But she's so young. She was so
young, and now, she is dead.

168
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:32,775
As dead as every dead animal
who has ever died.

169
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,279
God.

170
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:42,219
Why don't you sit down,
Michael? Come on.

171
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:45,797
There we go.

172
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,636
Michael, you didn't
even know her.

173
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,166
Try not to be
so hurtful, Jim.

174
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:59,541
Jim, how dare you? Please,
not at a time like this.

175
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:07,143
Okay, Michael, you know what?
I might have someone for you.

176
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:10,356
Oh, really? What's her name?
Burger King?

177
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:11,754
No, I mean it.

178
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:18,930
She's really nice and sweet and you
guys might actually get along.

179
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,624
I don't think I'm ready.
Is she hot?

180
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,399
I'm setting Michael up with my landlady.
She's really sweet, and...

181
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,936
Whatever, I just can't
take Michael like this.

182
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,343
No question about it,
I am ready to get hurt again.

183
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:37,015
We need to assemble
the F'ive F'amilies.

184
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,480
No, not the
F'ive F'amilies.

185
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,677
We have to!

186
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:44,122
The F'ive F'amilies are the five
companies of Scranton Business Park.

187
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,021
The bosses rarely meet.

188
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,955
There's Michael Scott, Regional
Manager, Dunder Mifflin.

189
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,760
Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

190
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:55,032
Paul Faust
of Disaster Kits Limited.

191
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:56,962
They call him "Cool Guy" Paul.

192
00:10:57,337 --> 00:11:00,670
W.B. Jones of
W.B. Jones Heating and Air.

193
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:02,640
Grade A badass.

194
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:07,975
And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Die.
Bill Cress is super old and really mean.

195
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:11,013
Kevin, I don't have time
for this right now.

196
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,609
I'm trying to get a date
with Pam's hot friend.

197
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,645
And she needs
to meet me right now.

198
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,654
I'm calling
the meeting anyway.

199
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,420
Thank you very much.

200
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:31,562
Our suspect has straight brown hair. She
is wearing blue jeans and a black top.

201
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:33,430
So...

202
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,306
Behold our bachelorette.

203
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:41,743
Give her a 10 for her looks, and a three
for her ability to describe herself.

204
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:44,674
Hello, my lady.

205
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:50,717
Michael?

206
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:52,213
Uh...

207
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,952
Are you Michael Scott?

208
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,757
Is who Michael what?

209
00:11:56,963 --> 00:12:00,364
I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be
meeting someone named Michael.

210
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:03,300
That's not... Yeah, I'm not...
Michael?

211
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,369
Michael?

212
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:10,102
Large hot chocolate with caramel
and a shot of peppermint.

213
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,675
So you

214
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:20,651
get the rent checks
every month, and...

215
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,213
What happens next? What...

216
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:30,656
You're asking me what I do with the
checks that people write to me?

217
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:33,756
Just making
conversation.

218
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,802
Why is it so hard to meet people?
I... You know, it's...

219
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,437
All I want is somebody
nice, and sweet,

220
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:48,481
and someone I can talk to and share
an experience with, you know?

221
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:52,249
Why is it so hard
for people like us?

222
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,445
I don't know.

223
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,890
You want to see
what I walked out on?

224
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,622
This is going to blow your mind.
Look at that!

225
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,725
She's beautiful.
Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,428
And you can't see her whole body,
down here, she has a boob job.

227
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,061
Just...

228
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:16,802
She was just crazy smart and
really manipulative, and...

229
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:17,968
I don't know.

230
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:21,343
Michael?
Hello, Michael?

231
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,580
Well, I'm gonna head out.

232
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:27,017
Oh, okay.

233
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,251
Well, I enjoyed
this conversation.

234
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,691
It was very nice.

235
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:38,654
It was like talking to the
sweet, old lady on the bus.

236
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,227
That's incredibly rude.

237
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:45,794
Now you ruined it.

238
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:49,572
Where's Scott?

239
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:53,100
Michael Scott could not make it today
due to an unforeseen prior engagement.

240
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,608
Let's just meet
back in an hour.

241
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,478
Gentlemen, please.

242
00:13:58,084 --> 00:13:59,676
We called
this meeting.

243
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,118
Andrew Bernard

244
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:07,057
is the name of me, and this is
my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.

245
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,955
I have things.

246
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,552
All right,
what do you want?

247
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:14,290
Well, first of all, I'd just
like to say what an honor it is

248
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,927
to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
You have about 10 seconds.

249
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,096
We want our parking
spaces back.

250
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:20,867
Whose parking spaces?

251
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,502
W.B. Jones' construction guys park
in our parking spaces every morning,

252
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:28,978
and some people have to
park really far away

253
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,810
and walk all the way
to the office.

254
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:34,350
And some people sweat too
much for comfort, and...

255
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,546
My God.

256
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:39,751
I don't have time for this, guys.
Just give them back their spaces.

257
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:42,021
Okay.
We good? Okay.

258
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,193
Could've done this
over e-mail.

259
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:53,829
After Stacy left, things did
not go well for a while.

260
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:56,264
And it was hard to see...

261
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:02,005
It's just nice
to win one.

262
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:09,015
Margaret the landlady? Really, Pam?
Is that what you think of me?

263
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:12,489
She's sweet and cute.
I thought you would get along.

264
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:17,790
Oh, okay. Well, I'm looking for a
passionate affair, not companionship.

265
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:20,332
I'm a man of intensity.

266
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:23,994
Of cool, and youth,

267
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,038
and passionately. God...

268
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,243
Margaret?
I know...

269
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:38,249
You just got yourself
kicked out of your apartment.

270
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,412
Oh, I don't care. I didn't really
like that place that much, anyway.

271
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:43,546
I'll just move.

272
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:44,681
Oh, really?

273
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:49,451
Who's gonna take you in? You're messy.
You're a klutz, you spill everything.

274
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:53,229
And you leave the volume
on the TV way too loud.

275
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,997
Yeah.

276
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:58,595
Maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend,
'cause he's kind of a slob, too.

277
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,538
Okay. Sure.
Let's do it.

278
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,606
No, I... Well, I'm not gonna...
I'm...

279
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,671
I'm not gonna move in with
anyone unless I'm engaged.

280
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:12,649
Have I not proposed
to you yet?

281
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:15,949
I don't... No.
Oh.

282
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,055
Well, that's coming.

283
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,490
Oh, right now?

284
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,228
No. I'm not gonna do it right here.
That would be rather lame.

285
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:27,198
Okay, so then when?

286
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,563
Pam, I'm not
gonna tell you.

287
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,499
I hate to break it to you,
but that's not how that works.

288
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,561
Oh, right. Yeah.

289
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:34,230
Wait, I'm serious.

290
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:35,797
It's happening.
Okay.

291
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:39,911
And when it happens, it's going
to kick your ass, Beesly.

292
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:43,247
So, stay sharp.

293
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:44,544
I've been warned.

294
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,450
I am not kidding.

295
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:59,224
Got it a week after
we started dating.

296
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:04,662
I don't know, man. I was
with Jan for so long...

297
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:10,003
I was excited about meeting somebody new.
Put my heart out there.

298
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,571
You know what
you need?

299
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:18,906
Closure.

300
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,212
You're right.

301
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:24,589
What do you mean, though?

302
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,753
There was a woman in your life
who affected you very deeply,

303
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:33,491
and she left before you could say goodbye.
I think you need to say goodbye.

304
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:36,924
Hmm.

305
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:39,334
Come on.
I'll drive.

306
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:42,301
We did it!
I did it.

307
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,275
We got our
spaces back.

308
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,336
Nice job.

309
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:49,574
Nice.
Yeah.

310
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:51,480
There it is.
You're welcome.

311
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:55,046
Did I do this
for me? No.

312
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:59,319
I did this for the little guy.
For Joe Six-Pack,

313
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:02,293
the guy who wakes up every morning
in his $400-a-month apartment,

314
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:05,728
wonders how he's gonna
pay his mortgage that month.

315
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,892
Wonders how he's gonna
fill his car up with oil.

316
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:12,665
Wonders, "How am I going to pay
my kids' orphanage bills?"

317
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:17,801
That guy shouldn't have to
wonder where he's gonna park.

318
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,088
How did she die?

319
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:41,192
I guess you could say
she died of

320
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,896
blunt-force trauma
and blood loss.

321
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:48,597
She got in a car accident and plowed
into the side of an airplane hangar.

322
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:50,198
God...
Yeah.

323
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,971
She was so innocent.

324
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:53,909
She was stoned,
apparently.

325
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,582
You know,
I used to think that

326
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,949
I had this perfect person
out there, waiting for me.

327
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,580
But now I know
that that's just silly.

328
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,657
Because she's dead.

329
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:08,955
What do you do?

330
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,929
You wait till next year's
chair catalogue comes out,

331
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:16,001
and you find someone
who's still alive.

332
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,059
You move on.
Yeah.

333
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,033
Where do you want
to go for dinner?

334
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:23,872
I don't know. I kind of hate all
our regular places right now.

335
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:25,766
Oh!

336
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:28,071
You know what?
That one...

337
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:31,513
Hey, Pam?

338
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:36,919
Will you wait for me one
second while I tie my shoe?

339
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:39,722
I hate you.
What?

340
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:43,387
My shoe is untied.
What is your problem?

341
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:46,056
Oh, my God!
You thought I...

342
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:47,929
No, no, no. How could
I have thought that?

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,433
How could I have
thought that?

344
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,066
Bye, bye

345
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:00,669
Miss chair model lady

346
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:07,643
I dreamt that we were married
and you treated me nice

347
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:11,218
We had lots of kids

348
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:15,123
Drinking whiskey and rye

349
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:19,761
But why'd you have
to go off and die?

350
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,630
Why'd you have
to go off and die?

351
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:31,976
You believe in rock 'n' roll?

352
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:35,707
Can music save
your mortal soul?

353
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,575
And then, can you
have to dance

354
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:42,151
real slow?

355
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:45,551
Well, I know
that you're in love with him

356
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:48,957
'Cause I saw you
dancing in the gym

357
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,922
Kicked off their shoes They
both turned off their shoes

358
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:55,998
No more rhythm and blues!
No verdict was returned!

359
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:58,329
Rhythm and blues

360
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:04,836
This will be the day
that I die
