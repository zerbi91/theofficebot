1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:05,338
Here are our final actual
costs for this year.

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,464
Okay.

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,091
As you can see,
we did pretty well, so...

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,551
Yes. Yes, I can see

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,471
that we did indeed.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,934
Why don't you explain this to
me like I am an eight-year-old?

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,562
All right, well, this is the overall
budget for this fiscal year

8
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,273
along the X axis.

9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,026
Yes. There's the X axix.
Right there.

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:31,531
You can see clearly on this
page that we have a surplus

11
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,032
of $4,300.

12
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,158
Okay.

13
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,827
But we have to spend that
by the end of the day

14
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,579
or it will be deducted
from next year's budget.

15
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,833
Why don't you explain
this to me like I'm five?

16
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,544
Your mommy and daddy
gave you $10

17
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,087
to open up a lemonade stand.

18
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,714
So you go out
and you buy cups

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,382
and you buy lemons
and you buy sugar.

20
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,218
And now you find out
that it only cost you $9.

21
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,096
So you have an extra dollar.
Yeah.

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,849
So you can give that dollar
back to Mommy and Daddy.

23
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,434
But guess what?
Next summer...

24
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,560
I'll be six.

25
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,062
And you ask them for money,
they're going to give you $9,

26
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,148
'cause that's what they think
it costs to run the stand.

27
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,902
So what you want to do is spend
that dollar on something now

28
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,779
so that your parents
think that it costs $10

29
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,030
to run the lemonade stand.

30
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,949
So the dollar's a surplus?
This is a surplus?

31
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,660
We have to spend that $4,300
by the end of the day

32
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,912
or it'll be deducted
from next year's budget.

33
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,127
We should spend this money on a new
copier, which we desperately need.

34
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,546
Okay. Break it down
in terms of...

35
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,175
Okay, I think
I'm getting you.

36
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,282
Guess what, everybody.

37
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,409
Christmas has
come early this year.

38
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,745
Oscar, very smartly,
has discovered

39
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,039
an extra $4,300
in the budget.

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,373
Thank you, Oscar.

41
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,793
And I have decided
with that money

42
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,171
I am going to buy a new...
Drum roll, please.

43
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,882
Can anybody guess?
New chairs?

44
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,759
No! A new copier!

45
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,052
All right.

46
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,306
Unless everybody can agree
on something better?

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,767
No, no, please.
Please do not do this.

48
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,228
Yes. Michael, new chairs.

49
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:29,190
These chairs are terrible. We were
supposed to get new ones last year.

50
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,360
So, we all agree to
get new chairs, then. Good?

51
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,320
Good. Yeah,
he said good. I'm good.

52
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,155
No, listen,
we are a paper company.

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,282
How can we take
pride in our jobs

54
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,327
if we have to put our fine paper
in this wretched machine?

55
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,703
Oscar, no.

56
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,289
This is not the time for one
of your principled stands.

57
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,124
Pam, you make more
copies than anyone.

58
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,377
Exactly. That should tell you
how terrible the chairs are.

59
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,754
Okay. Okay.
Good suggestions.

60
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:56,425
All good suggestions. Let's
just decide and agree upon one.

61
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,177
I'm with Pam. Chairs.

62
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,846
All right. So teams forming.

63
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,598
We should really have the
office's air quality tested.

64
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,016
I mean, we have radon
coming from below.

65
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,935
We have asbestos
in the ceilings.

66
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,144
These are silent killers.

67
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,271
You are the silent killer.

68
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,689
Go back to the annex.

69
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,731
You'll see.

70
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,358
Michael. I've talked to Meredith...
Yes.

71
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,943
...Stanley and Jim
about the chairs.

72
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,028
I know they're
with me on this.

73
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,197
Actually I'm going
to go with copier.

74
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,782
What? Jim.

75
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,492
Ever since Pam and
I started dating,

76
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,954
I just feel a little weird asking
her to make copies for me.

77
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,998
So I make my own copies.

78
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,294
And that copier sucks.
Let me tell you.

79
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,753
But you know what?

80
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,256
Pam and I don't have
to agree on everything.

81
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,467
Jim, good for you standing
up to Pam like that.

82
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,136
The balls on you, man.

83
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,470
So Michael,
what do you think?

84
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,014
Why me?

85
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,308
You have to
make the decision.

86
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:49,228
Wow! Okay. Well,
I swallowed all your ideas.

87
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,481
I'm going to digest them and see
what comes out the other end.

88
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,653
Dwight, I'm a little concerned
about some of these

89
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,739
directions to Schrute Farms.

90
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,781
Do tell.

91
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:05,453
I mean, like, "156 paces from the
light red mailbox, make a left.

92
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,789
"Walk until you
hear the bee hive."

93
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,583
How could it be
more clear?

94
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,667
They may not...

95
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,793
I think Andy makes
an excellent point.

96
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:13,878
Okay.

97
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,087
But my biggest concern is

98
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,213
that there's
only one bathroom.

99
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,673
We'll dig a trench.

100
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,884
As long as it's downhill from
the well, we should be fine.

101
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,428
Nana Mimi cannot
squat over some trench.

102
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,555
We're going to put out stumps.
Come on.

103
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,100
Let's three-way
this little issue

104
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,435
and come to a solution

105
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,355
by the time we get to Schrute Farms.
How's that for a plan?

106
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,900
We're getting married at
Schrute Farms, no matter what.

107
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,278
I have looked at 12 venues,
I have lost eight deposits

108
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,906
and I've seen Angela naked
zero times.

109
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,659
I am not losing
another deposit.

110
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,496
Hey.

111
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,705
Hey.

112
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,626
So, I've been
thinking about this whole

113
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,253
chair/copier thing and...
Mmm-hmm.

114
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,714
I really think you
should reconsider.

115
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,968
Pam, I really
hate that copier.

116
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,135
Yeah, I know.

117
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,303
Yeah.

118
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,722
But I really think
you should reconsider.

119
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,892
Beesly, are you
threatening me?

120
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:10,977
Jim!

121
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,231
Jim, Jim, Jim,
I'm not threatening you.

122
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,650
I love you.

123
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,487
But you should know you're
on very dangerous ground.

124
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,116
All right.

125
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,242
Okay.

126
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,581
This is where you'll
have your receiving line.

127
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,252
Of course, we'll clear out all
the livestock and hay and such.

128
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,339
What's that smell?

129
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,590
You're going to need
to be more specific.

130
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,217
Manure. Get rid of it.

131
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,553
Manure covers up the smell
of the slaughterhouse.

132
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,388
Do you have to slaughter
on our wedding day?

133
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,723
You want to eat, don't you?

134
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,766
Honey, say something!

135
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,728
Dwight, if we pay extra,

136
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,147
can you slaughter the entrées
the day before?

137
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,359
I'll consider it.

138
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,737
See? That's how you do it.

139
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,865
We're making progress here.

140
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,953
Darn!

141
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,705
There's a hose out back.
Okay.

142
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,915
Remember you were going to get a
new chair and you were going to

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,001
give your old chair to me?
Remember that? Yes.

144
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,210
Well, that never happened.
Michael?

145
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,171
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

146
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,380
I'm just going
to grab some lunch.

147
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,590
Want to come with?

148
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,550
Really? Absolutely.

149
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,843
Yeah, that would be amazing.

150
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,386
Thank you. Are you
guys going to lunch?

151
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,804
Yes.
Mind if I join?

152
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,556
Oh, God!

153
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
All right. Let's go.

154
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,142
Yeah. Best lunch ever.

155
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,978
Let's do it.
All right.

156
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,313
- Cool.
- Where are we going?

157
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,689
I have no idea.

158
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,317
So I guess that's how
they're going to play this.

159
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,235
It is on.

160
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,821
It is so on.

161
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,119
Look, I really need
this new chair.

162
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,537
I mean seriously.

163
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,289
How is it possible
that in five years,

164
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,374
I've had two
engagement rings

165
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,168
and only one chair?

166
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,928
Stop...

167
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,973
Michael.

168
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,767
Michael,
that is hilarious.

169
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,393
There was so much
egg on my face!

170
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,104
The best.

171
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,107
Great food. Great friends.
Thank you, Michael.

172
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,775
Thank you, guys.

173
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,033
I got you some tiramisu,
so no hard feelings.

174
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,869
Yeah.
That's cool.

175
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,873
Good stuff.

176
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,378
You look really pretty.

177
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,879
Thank you.

178
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,637
Yeah?
Michael?

179
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,721
Yeah.

180
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,181
Hey, you got a second?

181
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,100
- I do.
- Good.

182
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,434
That must have been so fun.

183
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,477
It was fun.

184
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,562
We had a good time.

185
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,397
Have I told you,
you look really nice today?

186
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,399
Thank you.
Yeah. Is that a new tie?

187
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,653
No. No. No, I got it
at T.J. Maxx, $4.

188
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,155
That is amazing.

189
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,490
You think that's good,
check out these pants.

190
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,908
$9.
What?

191
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,535
$9. Boys' department.
No.

192
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,912
Look at the ass.
Check out the ass.

193
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,747
Look at that.
No way.

194
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,417
Yeah!

195
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,712
So I guess Oscar and Jim were

196
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,380
talking your ear off
about the new copier, huh?

197
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,590
Yes, they were.
Yeah.

198
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,674
They were.

199
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,758
Here's what I was thinking.

200
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,263
Everyone sits on
a chair every day.

201
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,848
But not everyone...

202
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,600
Sits on a copier.

203
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,436
Or even uses
the copier every day.

204
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,687
Yeah.
Yeah, right?

205
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,105
Very valid.

206
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,274
That's it.
Okay.

207
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,359
All right, see you later.
See you.

208
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,861
Hot-tie guy.

209
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,280
Well.

210
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,867
Have you made a decision
on the butter sculpture?

211
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,785
No. I haven't thought of it.

212
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,872
Okay, cow, goat or sheep.
It's not that hard.

213
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,457
I would like a cat.

214
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,375
Cats don't make butter.

215
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,753
I would like a cow-butter
sculpture of a cat.

216
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,047
It doesn't make any sense. I
am telling you! Yes, it does!

217
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,256
I want a butter
sculpture of a cat!

218
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,633
Cow, goat or sheep.

219
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,218
What is this?

220
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,221
Right. We're all on
the same team. Is it...

221
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,432
Why is that in the kitchen?

222
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,811
Close the DF cover.

223
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,148
I did, though.

224
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,245
You might want to consider
changing teams because we would...

225
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,955
We would love to have you.

226
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,373
No, copier's great.

227
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,540
Is it?

228
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,376
Yeah. I have my copies.

229
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,710
There they are.

230
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,422
And I have my original.
You got it.

231
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,216
So suck it.
Okay.

232
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,468
Okay.

233
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,345
Michael, I got you
a hot chocolate.

234
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,721
I hope that's okay.

235
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,431
Thank you, my dear.

236
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,769
Wait, Michael, let me
open the door for you.

237
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,563
Well, chivalry is
not dead after all.

238
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,026
There he is.
There he is.

239
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,487
Hello, hello. Hello.

240
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,197
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

241
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,742
Yeah.
There's that ass.

242
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,536
Hey! Hey! Yeah!

243
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,747
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't take it away.

244
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,377
I almost choked.

245
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,130
Here's another place.

246
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,217
It's beautiful.

247
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,765
So, why don't we try this out
to see what would happen?

248
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,976
Give it a little test drive.
What do you say?

249
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,769
You pretend to be
Angela's father,

250
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,230
you will play Angela
and I will pretend to be you.

251
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,191
That way you can see what it
looks like when you're up here.

252
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,459
Hello.
I'm Angela Martin and...

253
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,543
I'm Andy.

254
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,794
I work with Dwight.

255
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,296
He doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

256
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
What?

257
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,550
Although born just minutes from
here, he speaks only German.

258
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,843
Closed society.

259
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,013
So, now, after the readings
by all of your sisters,

260
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,474
we will arrive at the vows.
So, Conrad...

261
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,648
This is a little taste of
the ceremony, if you will.

262
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,525
He's explaining
why we're here,

263
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,819
what we're doing here,
making introductions...

264
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,074
Then he's going to have Andy
repeat a bunch of stuff.

265
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,701
He's going to ask Andy
to produce a ring.

266
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,537
I have now just a...

267
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,374
Just some twine
for our purposes.

268
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,293
And you will put
the ring on her finger.

269
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:57,341
Then he's going to ask Andy if
he would like to marry Angela,

270
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,802
and you will reply, "I do."

271
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,597
And he's going to ask Angela if
she would like to marry Andy,

272
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,974
to which you will reply...

273
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,059
I do.

274
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,644
And there we go.

275
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,855
That's just about it.
Man and wife.

276
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,239
Got a call about
a problem up here.

277
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,573
Did somebody call Hank?

278
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,909
Hank, thank God you're here.

279
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,828
The office is
at a crossroads.

280
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,997
So, there's no
security problem?

281
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,707
You know,
I hustled up the stairs.

282
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,377
Yes, I need
your sage advice.

283
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:38,632
And everyone, whatever Hank
decides, that is the decision.

284
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,385
That will resolve this issue.

285
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,140
Yeah, take as
many as you want.

286
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,266
Thank you. Thank you.

287
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,934
You know,
it's nice and warm up here.

288
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,185
Yes.

289
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,478
Well, what are we
talking about?

290
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,440
Okay, well,
we have a surplus.

291
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,609
Imagine that your parents give you
money for a lemonade stand...

292
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,445
I know what a surplus is.

293
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,946
Okay. Good. Good.

294
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,698
Well, here's the thing.

295
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,784
Some people want to use the
surplus to buy a new copier,

296
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,787
other people are complaining
about the chairs.

297
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,830
Is that the copier?

298
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,206
It is. Yes.

299
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,765
Hmm...

300
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,976
What? No, I was just thinking.
Let me see a chair.

301
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,645
Okay. Here we go.
You can try mine.

302
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,153
Hmm. Not much lumbar support.

303
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:46,116
Now, everyone bear in mind once
again that whatever Hank says goes.

304
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,327
He is an impartial
third party.

305
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,871
On the one hand,
this copier is very old.

306
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,581
You should see some of the
new copiers they have.

307
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
You would not
believe what they do.

308
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,250
So the copier?

309
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,752
- Well, let me finish.
- All right. Yes.

310
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,506
Now the chairs.
The chairs are very weak.

311
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,593
Very weak chairs. I could not
sit all day in this chair.

312
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,262
Well, what should I do?

313
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,100
Let me see the copier again.

314
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,811
All right, get out.
Get out. It's...

315
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,605
Dwight...

316
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,816
I thought I knew
what I wanted.

317
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,986
And then being here with you

318
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,489
and the German
Mennonite minister,

319
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,449
it just all felt right.

320
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,413
I made a mistake
picking Andy.

321
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,666
I know you did.

322
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,670
And that's why I have
taken care of everything.

323
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,963
What do you mean?

324
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,464
Well, monkey,

325
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,175
he's a real minister
and you said "I do"

326
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,470
and I said "I do" and Andy
wasn't signing a receipt.

327
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,724
He was signing our marriage
certificate as a witness.

328
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,518
Dwight, that doesn't count!

329
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,602
Yes, of course it does.

330
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,728
No! It doesn't.

331
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,106
It does in
the state of Pennsylvania.

332
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,190
Mrs. Schrute.

333
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,817
I didn't...
We are not married!

334
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,819
What?
Take this thing.

335
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,947
It's not my fault
you don't understand German!

336
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,324
I've been telling you
to take it for years!

337
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,495
Are we leaving or what?

338
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,542
Michael.

339
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,626
Hey, David.

340
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,630
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm eating tiramisu.

341
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,259
Some of the chocolate powder
just went down my throat.

342
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,343
I'm stopping now.

343
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,595
Is this why
you're calling me?

344
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,805
No, no, no, no, no. No.

345
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,432
I'm calling...

346
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,186
Sorry.
Okay.

347
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,524
I'm calling because

348
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,153
we have a stupid budget
surplus and people...

349
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,779
Everybody wants
something different.

350
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,823
You want me to weigh in
on a minor budget issue?

351
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,160
No, no, no. I want you to make the
decision so I'm not the bad guy.

352
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,579
Well, if I were you I would
just return the surplus

353
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,080
and take the bonus.

354
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,624
The what now?

355
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,294
Branch managers who come in under
budget get 15% of the savings.

356
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,589
Like a tip?

357
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,758
$645?

358
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,595
I hate disappointing
just one person.

359
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,723
And I really hate
disappointing everyone.

360
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,269
But I love
Burlington Coat Factory.

361
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:24,691
You go in there with $645,
you are literally a king.

362
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,655
Yeah, we have that
going on Tuesday.

363
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,739
Okay?

364
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,368
Sure. No, I can... I'll
double-check that for you.

365
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,454
All right,
attention, everyone.

366
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,997
Let me call you
right back. Okay.

367
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,291
I have made my decision.

368
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:45,337
We do not need a new copier,
we do not need new chairs.

369
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,757
This copier is

370
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,933
working perfectly.

371
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,601
That's the original.

372
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,604
Pam, would you
stand up for a sec?

373
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,526
Hmmm.

374
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,947
See how relaxed I am?
I like this chair.

375
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,783
Offers good support.

376
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,036
It is erchonomically correct.

377
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,538
It's a good chair.

378
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:24,626
I think we're spoiled because we don't
appreciate the things that we have.

379
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,213
You think kids in
Africa have chairs? No.

380
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,507
They sit in big
piles of garbage.

381
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,633
Do you think
they have copiers?

382
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,511
They don't have copiers.
They don't even...

383
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,391
They don't even have paper. And we
are spoiled because we throw out

384
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,019
perfectly good tiramisu because
it has a little tiny hair on it.

385
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:47,566
My point is this, I have seen the
light in terms of what we need,

386
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,317
and it is nothing.

387
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,154
Do you know?
Do I know what?

388
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,280
I think you know.

389
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,364
No.

390
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,949
Know what?
Yeah, know what?

391
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,744
Does anyone happen to know
what 15% of 4,300 is?

392
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,287
$645.

393
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,830
Michael's a genius.
Right.

394
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,081
Why did you say "dollars"?

395
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,000
Because that is
how my mind works.

396
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,626
What's 15% of 200?

397
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,548
Thank you. Everyone, Michael
is returning the surplus

398
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,133
so he can keep
15% as a bonus.

399
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,259
Wait, what?

400
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,011
- You can do that?
- Hey, Michael.

401
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,640
What's 394 times 5912?

402
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,392
Let's see.
You're going to give yourself

403
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,436
a bonus of $645

404
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,688
instead of getting the entire
office something it really needs?

405
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,440
I don't need $645.

406
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,151
I already have $645,
more or less.

407
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,903
You're going to get us a copier then?
This is stupid.

408
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,113
Or chairs.
This is so, so stupid.

409
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,366
And, God, that's my phone.

410
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,951
I didn't hear
a phone ring.

411
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,661
To be continued!

412
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,793
No, I don't...
This doesn't change anything.

413
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,670
I have a very important
decision to make.

414
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,923
We need a new copier,
we need new chairs,

415
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,176
and I need to figure out
a way to keep this money

416
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,678
without having
everybody hate me.

417
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,432
Hey, Tuna, check it out.
Tuna sandwich.

418
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,267
Just like you.

419
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,980
What?

420
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,160
Now, I have to take
care of a legal issue.

421
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,084
Was that hot or what?

422
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,502
So what's it going to be?

423
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,628
Michael, you have
to make a decision.

424
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,712
The day is almost done.

425
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,506
Let me just say you've been
promising me this chair

426
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,674
since the day
you hired me.

427
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,843
You are a smart guy. I know
you'll do the right thing.

428
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,305
You think it's easy?
It's your job.

429
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,851
Okay, you know what, why
don't you guys deal with it?

430
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,937
I am going to get up and I'm going
to be out in the common area

431
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:54,651
but you need to decide, otherwise
I'm taking the bonus. All right?

432
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,572
It is a classic management tactic.
You have two sides,

433
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:02,367
a deadline, you know that neither
of them are going to concede,

434
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,494
what you do is you put them
in a room and you just...

435
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,579
Hey.
Hey!

436
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,705
Hey, we're going
with the chairs.

437
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,747
What?

438
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,750
I just figured I'd rather have
new chairs than nothing at all.

439
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,377
Thanks, Michael.

440
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,629
Good work.
I'm proud of you.

441
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,258
Mother...

442
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,759
What have we learned this week?

443
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,096
Well, one, thanks to me,

444
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,183
my team is much, much faster
at coming to decisions

445
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,269
than I thought they would be.

446
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,106
Number two, never buy a fur coat
with a credit card until you

447
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,776
absolutely have
the money to pay for it.

448
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,905
And three, you should know

449
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,281
that some people
think it's cool

450
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,033
to throw buckets
of fake blood on you

451
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,744
as you are walking out
of Burlington Coat Factory.

452
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,166
Truce?

453
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,752
Yeah, I guess, since I won.

454
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,087
You did win. You did win.

455
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,924
Anyway, I'm going to need three
copies of each of these,

456
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,926
stapled and collated.

457
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,347
I'm totally kidding.

458
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,350
I'm going to need four.
