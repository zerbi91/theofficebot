1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,090
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Pam.

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,175
I'm sorry,
he's not in yet.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,386
Would you like
his voice-mail?

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,554
Yeah!

5
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:16,557
Yeah! Yeah! Okay.

6
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,186
Twelve miles an hour.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,271
Eat that, Carl Lewis!

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,608
Angela made several
911 calls about cars

9
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,610
going too fast in front
of the building,

10
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,029
so the police put up
a radar gun.

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,825
It's actually caused a
bit of a traffic hazard.

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,955
Wow, 13.

13
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,790
- No, no, no.
- Yeah!

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,667
There was wind.
I was just jogging.

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,544
Dwight, there was wind.
I want a do over.

16
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,754
No, no, no, it's not your turn.
All right, 13 is the new number.

17
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:47,880
Oscar, go ahead.

18
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,299
I want another try.
Here we go!

19
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,887
Thirty-one! 31!

20
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,055
There was a car.

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,307
I was ahead of the car.
Thirty-one is my new number.

22
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,726
Thirty-one is
humanly impossible.

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,728
Go, Oscar.
Thirty-one is my number.

24
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,813
That's impossible.
Beat it!

25
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,837
Today's a big day. My
presence has been requested

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:33,342
by Chief Financial Officer,
David Wallace.

27
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,348
He says that he wants to talk
about big picture stuff,

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,770
and, I'll be honest, I have little
or no idea what that means.

29
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,355
So, probably bad.

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,818
Quick announcement.
New year, new candy.

31
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,155
Okay, be careful, Kevin.
They're kind of spicy.

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,490
Hot Tamales.

33
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,699
Yeah.
Uh-oh.

34
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,409
So maybe just try
one at first,

35
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,953
and then if it's okay,
have a couple more.

36
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,207
Excuse me, everyone, can I
have the floor, please?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,250
Um...

38
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,878
This is insanely awkward.

39
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,632
It's kind of the elephant
in the room, so I'll just...

40
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,761
No one has RSVPed
to our wedding yet,

41
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,679
and the deadline
was yesterday.

42
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,848
Wait, you still
don't know...

43
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,934
No, no. No.

44
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,477
Hmm?

45
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,812
Nothing.
You still don't know...

46
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,480
Why don't... Let's...
What are you doing?

47
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,732
How about we just... I just have
to talk to you for a second.

48
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,067
Andy. Has...
Ah.

49
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,069
No. No one has RSVPed,

50
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,571
and I don't understand it, and
now you're shutting me out.

51
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,533
You're not even listening, and that's
really considerate. Thank you.

52
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,826
No, what I'm saying...
No, no.

53
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,993
No, that's not...
I know...

54
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,914
Andy still doesn't know that Angela
is having an affair with Dwight.

55
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,042
And it's been 17 days.

56
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,044
I mean, eventually
he'll figure it out

57
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,673
when their kids have giant
heads and beet-stained teeth.

58
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,342
But right now,
it's just awkward.

59
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,845
How can
he still not know?

60
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,930
We can't figure that out.
I can't take it anymore.

61
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,640
Wait, what?
You can't take what?

62
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,766
I'm telling Andy,
Dwight.

63
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,934
No, you can't do that.
Yes.

64
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,936
It shouldn't come from you. Who
should it come from, then?

65
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,062
Angela.
Angela.

66
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,772
From Angela.
Angela.

67
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,942
Are you still having
intercourse with her?

68
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,195
What is wrong with you?
She is engaged.

69
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,282
Did you ever have
intercourse in this office?

70
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,827
Are you serious?

71
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,788
Where?

72
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,666
Where?

73
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,170
Where, Dwight?

74
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,923
Seems like you
already know where.

75
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,679
Kevin, you screwed
this form up again.

76
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,598
The amount owed
goes at the top.

77
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,058
Oh, I'm sorry.

78
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,020
I didn't realize I was
doing something wrong.

79
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:54,108
If I had, I would have admitted
it and stopped right away.

80
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,234
That's enough.

81
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,571
Because I wouldn't want
an innocent person

82
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,490
who doesn't know anything
about the form...

83
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,245
What?

84
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,496
That was good.

85
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,166
It's just at the end you
weren't saying something

86
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,376
that could also
apply to the form.

87
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,586
How about,

88
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,214
"I'm sorry I did such a whorish
job filling out this form"?

89
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,758
There you go.

90
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,471
That cannot be true!

91
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,683
You're going to charge me
a fee to cut my own cake?

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,394
No, no, no, no.

93
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,896
What I'm saying is
I want to cut it myself.

94
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,022
Trade seats with me.

95
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,106
No.

96
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,900
I've got a better
angle on Pam.

97
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,485
I can see everything.

98
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,945
Please stop.

99
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,201
I need a soup spoon.

100
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,872
Rule 17, don't turn your back
on bears, men you have wronged,

101
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,208
or the dominant turkey
during mating season.

102
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,462
There are 40 rules all Schrute boys
must learn before the age of five.

103
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,800
Learn your rules
You better learn your rules

104
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,886
if you don't you'll be
eaten in your sleep

105
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,735
What is it?

106
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,487
You've gotta tell
Andy about us.

107
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,698
That is a terrible idea.
One of your worst.

108
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,950
Get it over with. Then we
don't have to hide anymore.

109
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,702
You're expanding
on your worst idea.

110
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,203
Do you love me or not?

111
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,122
I've already admitted
that I do.

112
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,082
Why do you keep
making me repeat it?

113
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,459
Because you're
engaged to Andy.

114
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,472
Well?

115
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,766
Not yet.
When?

116
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,560
When what?

117
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,354
When what?

118
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,440
You know
this can't go on.

119
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,027
What can't go on? We have
to put an end to this.

120
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,237
- Seems like...
- Come on.

121
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,782
...you guys should be
hearing what I'm saying.

122
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,911
This is really not how this
is supposed to happen.

123
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,205
Angela said she was gonna tell him.
She's just not ready.

124
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,207
When will she be ready?
I don't know.

125
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,459
Is she crazy in bed?
Yes.

126
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,543
Stop. What?
How so, specifically?

127
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,919
Okay, listen.

128
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,504
This shouldn't happen at work.
Eager and flexible.

129
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,714
And...
Really?

130
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,923
...this shouldn't be
coming from his boss.

131
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,093
And we should also consider the fact
that that man has an anger issue.

132
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,803
Too late.
Well, it's not too late

133
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,556
'cause you haven't done anything.
I am already walking.

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,392
Michael, once this gets out...
Yes?

135
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,227
...I don't know how
it's gonna go down.

136
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,021
Okay, what does that mean?

137
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,773
Might get ugly.

138
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:43,027
Jim, this has to get out
so we can all deal with it.

139
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,321
But you're leaving.

140
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,492
Have a good trip. Thanks.

141
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,036
Andy?
Yeah?

142
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,412
Walk with me.

143
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,663
Will do, boss man.

144
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,511
I do not
have much time.

145
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,931
Car's all the way
over there.

146
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,351
To tell you what I
have to tell you.

147
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,523
And just bear in mind that
when I say these things

148
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:26,779
that are bad things that
you hear in your ears,

149
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,449
this is something that I,

150
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,993
if I were you,
that I wouldn't want to hear.

151
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,286
You're not making
any sense.

152
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,665
Well, no, I'm not.

153
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,960
So I, I'm not
very articulate today,

154
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,462
so I'll just leave it
for another time.

155
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,132
Another day.
All righty.

156
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,300
Which will be fine.
I am off.

157
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,803
Have a good meeting.
Thank you.

158
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,139
Kick Wallace's ass.

159
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,391
Okay, I will.

160
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,978
Dwight and Angela are
having an affair, so...

161
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,772
I can't hear you
through the glass.

162
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,816
Dwight and Angela
are having an affair.

163
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,318
They've been sleeping
together for some time.

164
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,280
That was the news.
I wanted to let you know.

165
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,782
What?
All right. See you later.

166
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,829
Are you serious?
Yeah.

167
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,851
I knew something bad
was gonna happen today.

168
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,977
You said that
yesterday.

169
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,021
Yeah, my neighbor
got murdered.

170
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,230
What are you standing for?

171
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,192
If I'm sitting, I can't disable
his neck or his groin.

172
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,235
You're not gonna do anything
to his neck or his groin.

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,696
If I'm sitting, I don't
have the option to.

174
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,783
Dwight, I'm in charge while Michael's
gone, and I need you to sit.

175
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,885
I need to talk to you.

176
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,136
We can talk right here.

177
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,555
I need to talk to you
in private.

178
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,598
We're not listening.

179
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,100
Let's go to the
conference room.

180
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,897
Is it true?

181
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,608
What have you heard? That
you're sleeping with Dwight.

182
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,151
That doesn't
sound like me.

183
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,236
Is it true?

184
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,112
Andy, I'm engaged
to you.

185
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,907
I mean, we just signed off
on our wedding flowers.

186
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,867
Would I have said yes
to formal chrysanthemums

187
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,244
if I didn't want
to get married?

188
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,371
And we went through all that
stuff with our wedding cake.

189
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,916
Just answer the question.
Are you sleeping with Dwight?

190
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,794
A little bit.

191
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,005
How long has this
been going on?

192
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,257
I don't know.

193
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,093
I mean, we were together, and
then he killed Sprinkles,

194
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,011
and then we stopped
and...

195
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,099
I don't know exactly when
we started up again.

196
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,267
Who else knows about it?

197
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,434
Michael.

198
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,019
Who else?

199
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,730
Let me think about it.
I, um...

200
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,108
They're...

201
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,317
Oh, God.

202
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,111
Come on!

203
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,533
So listen, Michael, your branch
has been doing great lately,

204
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,287
and your sales staff is
reporting very strong numbers.

205
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,206
Outperforming last year,
in fact.

206
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,377
And I don't know
exactly how to put this,

207
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:35,092
but what are you
doing right?

208
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,845
Right what?

209
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,014
Utica, Albany, all the other
branches are struggling,

210
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,851
but your branch is
reporting strong numbers.

211
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,270
Look, you're not
our most traditional guy,

212
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:50,190
but clearly something
you are doing is right,

213
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,402
and I just... I need to get
a sense of what that is.

214
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:59,158
David, here it is. My
philosophy is basically this.

215
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,202
And this is something
that I live by,

216
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,413
and I always have,
and I always will.

217
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:11,253
Don't ever, for any reason,
do anything to anyone

218
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:17,634
for any reason ever, no
matter what, no matter where,

219
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,974
or who, or who you are with,
or where you are going,

220
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,311
or where you've been

221
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,231
ever,

222
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,026
for any reason
whatsoever...

223
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,904
Sometimes I'll start a sentence and
I don't even know where it's going.

224
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,531
I just hope I find
it along the way.

225
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,116
Like an improv
conversation.

226
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,660
An improversation.

227
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,829
This is gonna sound
sort of high maintenance,

228
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,290
but could we have it, like,
three degrees cooler in here?

229
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,876
I always think better
when it's cooler.

230
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,670
Here's the thing, Michael
is doing something right,

231
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,589
and in this
economic climate,

232
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,050
no method of success
can be ignored.

233
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,553
It's not really a time for executives
to start getting judgmental now.

234
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,055
It's Hail Mary time.

235
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,100
Hey, what say
we order up some pasta?

236
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,228
What say we do.

237
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,981
Standard, you know.
Nothing fancy.

238
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,358
So, like, missionary?

239
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,235
I said nothing fancy.

240
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,611
Do you love him?

241
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,405
I love you.

242
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,073
Why should I believe that?

243
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,701
Andy, we are at
a crossroads here,

244
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,163
and we can either give in
to what people are saying,

245
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,623
that we're not
good together...

246
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,749
Who says that?

247
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,127
...or we can
prove them wrong.

248
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,088
Let's prove
them wrong.

249
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,514
Where's Dwight?

250
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,932
You okay, man?

251
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,603
No, not at all, actually. But
thanks for asking. Appreciate it.

252
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,647
You know what? I'd also like
to take this opportunity

253
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,025
to thank all of you
for lying to my face

254
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,778
and not telling me what's been
going on this entire time.

255
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,447
You are welcome.

256
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,203
Dwight.

257
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,039
Andy.

258
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,126
It's over.

259
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,794
Good.
She broke up with you.

260
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,881
No, it's over
between you two.

261
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,342
No way.
I am not giving up.

262
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,761
You have to.
No, I don't.

263
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,474
She doesn't love you.
She's marrying me.

264
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,808
Well, I don't know
about that

265
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:34,438
because she certainly seems to
enjoy making lovemaking with me.

266
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,148
Angela Bernard...

267
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,233
Will never be her name.

268
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,695
Will be her name and you
will have to call her that.

269
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,071
I don't think so.

270
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,241
Hey, guys. Why don't we
just cool off a bit?

271
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,451
I'm telling you
to back down.

272
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,077
And I'm telling you that
I will never back down.

273
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,162
Then I'll make you.

274
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,747
Oh, really? How are
you going to do that?

275
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,165
Through the use of force.

276
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,500
That is very general

277
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,001
and does not scare me
in the slightest.

278
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,503
I will fight you.

279
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,839
Nope.
Okay, fine. Good! A duel.

280
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,050
The winner gets Angela.
Fine!

281
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,593
Fine!
This is nuts.

282
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,094
What is your weapon?
Okay, you know what?

283
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,221
That's enough
because...

284
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,347
Hey, this is none
of your business.

285
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,807
Hey, it is my business
what happens at work.

286
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,268
Guess what? Not happening at work.
Yes.

287
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,145
We're gonna do it outside.
Outside of work.

288
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,524
None of your business.
None of your business, then.

289
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,067
Good, so what weapon?

290
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,193
My bare hands.

291
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,196
That is stupid. I will use a sword,
and I will cut off your bare hands.

292
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,656
Then I'll get
something, too.

293
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,367
I've had two men
fight over me before.

294
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,994
Usually it's over which one
gets to hold the camcorder.

295
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,248
Angela, you have to put a
stop to this right now.

296
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,629
I will respect the
results of the duel.

297
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,423
Of course you will.
I call loser.

298
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:48,470
I will be taking my break
at 4:00 in the parking lot.

299
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,181
I will also be
taking my break

300
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,142
at the exact same time
and in the same location.

301
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,312
What a coincidence.
Hmm.

302
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,449
So, I either get more involved
or I take a sick day.

303
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,580
Leaving Dwight in charge.
Oh, God.

304
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,175
How'd that get there?

305
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,182
There's a star-shaped thing
taped under the kitchen table.

306
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,892
Thanks, Meredith.

307
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,687
So I was in the office,

308
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:44,526
and I look over to our accounting
division, and there's Kevin Malone.

309
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:48,447
Kevin is wearing a jacket
that I've never seen before,

310
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,116
and I call over
to Kevin,

311
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,370
"Kevin, is that
a tweed jacket?"

312
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,289
And he looks at me
and he says,

313
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,625
"Michael, yes,
it is a tweed jacket."

314
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,668
And I look back
at him and I say,

315
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:06,256
"I feel the need,
the need for tweed."

316
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,385
It's hard to try and
evaluate yourself, Michael,

317
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,679
but I appreciate
you trying.

318
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,432
And thanks for coming in.
Oh!

319
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,309
Thank you.
Yes.

320
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,144
I have to say,
I am so impressed

321
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,688
with the potential
you see in me.

322
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,733
Yeah.
Okay.

323
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,574
Yeah, finish up.

324
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,120
Come on! Where are you?

325
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,248
Let's do this thing!

326
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,585
Come on!
Come on out!

327
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,089
I can't believe they're
gonna fight over me.

328
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,425
I guess people have fewer
choices as they get older.

329
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,885
Come on!

330
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,845
Hey, has anything
happened yet?

331
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,347
Where are you?
It's 4:10.

332
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,431
I don't think
he's gonna show.

333
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,518
Oh, come on, man.
Believe in something.

334
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:06,108
Come on, coward! Where are you?
Where...

335
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,366
"From the desk
of Andrew Bernard."

336
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,911
A note. Pathetic.

337
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:23,750
"Dear Dwight, by now you have received
my note. How are you? I am well.

338
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,420
"You are no doubt wondering
why I have left this note.

339
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,797
"It's come to my attention that
in any physical match with you,

340
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,174
"I would surely
be bested." True.

341
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:36,138
"The soft underbelly of my refined
upbringing is my soft underbelly."

342
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,390
There's Andy.
He's in his car.

343
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,766
You guys,
what is he doing?

344
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,476
Why isn't Dwight
turning around?

345
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,021
The Prius is silent if he keeps
it under five miles per hour.

346
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,398
He deserves the win.

347
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,066
"Alas, after
much consideration..."

348
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,317
Oh, my God!

349
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,402
What's happening?

350
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,779
Andy's running
over Dwight with his car.

351
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,699
Whoa! What are you...
Hey, hey!

352
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,783
Yeah!

353
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:58,994
Come on! Ow!

354
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,037
My God.

355
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,999
You give up?
Never!

356
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,834
Get out and face me
like a man!

357
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,754
I am a man! I'm a bigger
man than you'll ever be!

358
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,006
I would never sleep
with another man's fiancee!

359
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,259
You're not a man! You don't
know how to take care of her!

360
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,887
All you do is
dress fancy and sing.

361
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,973
What does that mean?

362
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,433
You can't even
protect her!

363
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,144
Protect her from what?
Bears, you idiot?

364
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,438
When's the last time you saw
a damn bear in Scranton?

365
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,398
Last year, idiot!

366
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,859
Dwight, are your
legs broken?

367
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,778
No, my right one's falling
asleep a little bit.

368
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:33,945
Andy,
are you all right?

369
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,114
Go away, Tuna!
I'm winning this!

370
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,200
Yeah, back off.
This isn't your fight.

371
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,119
Oh! How much is this
gonna cost? Oh!

372
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,497
What? Trust fund'll
take care of that.

373
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,041
What did you say? I'm
sorry, I couldn't hear you.

374
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,542
I said...

375
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,836
What? You stupid idiot!

376
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,422
You're like a big... You're like a
Sasquatch. You live in the woods!

377
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,300
Sasquatches are the strongest
animal on the planet!

378
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,385
So fine,
call me a Sasquatch.

379
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,305
I don't get it! How could she be
sleeping with you this whole time

380
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,933
and only sleep
with me twice?

381
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,935
What?
What?

382
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,937
She's sleeping with you?

383
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,773
I'm her fiance.

384
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,691
She said she was only
sleeping with me.

385
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,238
Yes, hi,
my last name is Bernard,

386
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,117
and I would like to cancel a
wedding cake that I had ordered.

387
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,789
B-E-R-N-A-R-D.

388
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,252
Yeah, one shaped
like a sailboat.

389
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,464
Yep, that's the one.

390
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,551
Thank you.

391
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,222
Wow, what a day.

392
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,058
I thought I was
gonna get chewed out,

393
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,896
but hold on, here's an
attaboy for you. What?

394
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,649
Rollercoaster ride.
Rollercoaster.

395
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:39,195
It just goes to show, you leave
Scranton, exciting things can happen.
