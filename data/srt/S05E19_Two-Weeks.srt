1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,796
I had no idea, when I got into
that car to go to New York,

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,422
that I was going
to be quitting.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,592
I got on the ramp, and I
was, like, "Two hours.

4
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:13,262
"Two hours to go. Feeling good.
Crank some tunes.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,681
"Should've peed
before I left."

6
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:15,765
Michael,
get to the good part.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,810
Okay, so,
get up to the building.

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,562
Revolving door, broken.

9
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,941
So I have to take
the normal door.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,984
Oh, my God.
At least he's in the building.

11
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,361
No! No.

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,279
I was so nervous,
it was the wrong building.

13
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,448
I had walked into
the wrong building.

14
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,410
He finally has a story
we really wanna hear.

15
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,203
And he knows it.

16
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,663
Okay, focus, focus.

17
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,958
You're in the right building,
you're with the right people,

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,042
what happened?

19
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:44,711
I looked at Wallace
and I said,

20
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,045
"I quit."

21
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,173
And as I turned to leave,
I looked back,

22
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:53,261
and I said, "You have no
idea how high I can fly."

23
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,555
You didn't tell him
how sick of him you were?

24
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,848
Why would I do that?

25
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,726
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell
him that he's incompetent or...

26
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,353
That he's wasted 15
years of your life?

27
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:03,730
Maybe spit in his face?

28
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,232
You guys have thought about
this a lot more than I have.

29
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,984
I just winged it.

30
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,528
I love a good
quitting story.

31
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,281
It makes me feel like I have
control over my own life.

32
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,782
Gives me hope.

33
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,577
Maybe I'll have
one of my own someday.

34
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,288
But I dream.

35
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,498
So...

36
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,822
About a week ago, Michael
gave his two-weeks' notice.

37
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,493
And surprisingly, there
is a very big difference

38
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,704
between Michael trying
and Michael not trying.

39
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,373
Michael, is that Scotch?

40
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,958
Scotch and Splenda.

41
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,045
Tastes like Splenda,
gets drunk like Scotch.

42
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,176
Clinky. Clinky-clink. Come on.

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,636
Come on. Come on.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,970
What am I gonna do?

45
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,889
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

46
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,475
I'm gonna do a little bit of
this and a little bit of that.

47
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,811
I'm gonna stay up all day.

48
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,145
I'm gonna
sleep up all night.

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,147
I'm gonna give it a...

50
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,191
Ho! Hey Ho!

51
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,612
And I'm gonna stop
worrying about calories.

52
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,783
Maybe you should go into
your office, close the door

53
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,660
and make some
calls about jobs.

54
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,786
I have a job.

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,162
For four more days.

56
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,997
Do you have any
leads on a job?

57
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,457
Pam, what you don't
understand, at my level,

58
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,334
you don't just look in
the want ads for a job.

59
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,418
You're headhunted.

60
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,545
Have you called
any headhunters?

61
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,755
Any good headhunter knows
that I'm available.

62
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,216
Any really good headhunter will
storm your village at sunset

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,094
with overwhelming force and cut off
your head with a ceremonial knife.

64
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,180
Right, 'cause that's
what we're talking about.

65
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,765
I need you to go over
these client lists

66
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,934
and indicate any
wrong or false data.

67
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,228
Your "I need you
to" is my command.

68
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,479
Okay.

69
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,742
Hey, Michael.
Hey.

70
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,035
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,246
You can talk to me for
as long as you want,

72
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,124
because I have all the
time in the world.

73
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,625
Oh, God.

74
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,711
Phyllis.

75
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,923
I just wanted to
tell you that...

76
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,385
What's that?
Oh! Hey!

77
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,095
What is this about?

78
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,015
You know, 'cause you're
leaving and everything.

79
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,099
It's a farewell...

80
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,183
Right.

81
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,394
So I hope I get to work
with you someday again.

82
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,062
Me, too. Me, too.

83
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,567
Is this wine?
Busted. Yes.

84
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,652
I already have wine.

85
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,907
Hello.
Hi.

86
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,366
Isaac Sylvie here
for the interview.

87
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,410
Yes, please have a seat.
It'll be a few minutes.

88
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,828
Thank you.

89
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,416
Are you interviewing, too?

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,084
Um. Hmm?

91
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,253
Interviewing?

92
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:15,922
For?

93
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,048
Regional manager.

94
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,842
Yes, I am.

95
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:24,263
For regional manager, I've decided
to go with an outside hire.

96
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,098
For obvious reasons.

97
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,768
Where you from?
Philly.

98
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,102
That's a drive.

99
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,939
Yeah, well, this is one of the
few places that's hiring.

100
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,399
It's brutal out there.

101
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,616
Pam?

102
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,159
When will the new
copier be ready?

103
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,577
I'm working on it, Kev.

104
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,788
You said it would
be ready by today.

105
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,539
And it is today.

106
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,124
It'll be ready soon.

107
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,918
Soon could mean anything.

108
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,045
Soon could be three weeks.

109
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,381
Is that what
soon means to you?

110
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,882
Sometimes.

111
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,884
Then come back soon.

112
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,972
During the course of business a
copier goes through something called

113
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,723
normal wear and tear.

114
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,393
I think it's 75 cents.

115
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,477
That's a lot.

116
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,230
Bandit, no! No, no, no!

117
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,192
Yesterday,
they delivered the new one.

118
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,069
But they didn't set it up.

119
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,239
So my day just got
a little more interesting.

120
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,579
It's monster.com. Singular.

121
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,498
Thank you.

122
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,294
You work in paper long enough,
you get to know the players.

123
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,840
Hi,
you've reached Prince Paper.

124
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,927
We are sad to inform you that after
40 years of serving the community,

125
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,846
we are no longer in business.

126
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,016
Thank you for your support
and may God bless you.

127
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,142
Bye!

128
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,691
What am I gonna do?

129
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,382
Yep? Do you want me
to come into your office?

130
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,637
Okay.

131
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,848
All right.

132
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,892
Close your eyes.
I'd prefer not to.

133
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,810
Just close your eyes.

134
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,942
I'm going to start
my own paper company.

135
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,737
You're starting your own
paper company. Yeah!

136
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,614
Why?
Can you believe...

137
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,159
'Cause I know paper. I know everything
there is to know about paper.

138
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,702
Do you that the
industry's in decline?

139
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,538
Yeah. Oh, God, I practically
invented decline.

140
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,623
Right.

141
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,167
I know paper,
I know how to manage.

142
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,585
I have a name.
Close your eyes.

143
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,253
No, I did that before.
It added nothing.

144
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,005
Close them.
Okay.

145
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,008
All right.
Michael Scott Paper Company.

146
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,512
You want in? Do you want
to be a part of this?

147
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,348
I am not going to do this.

148
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,350
Obviously.

149
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,102
And you are not
going to, either.

150
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,687
Agreed. Except...

151
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,814
Here's the thing.

152
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,274
What I wish for you is that
you land a job at a company

153
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,778
that A, exists,
and B, has a salary,

154
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,197
because they're set up
to do that kind of thing.

155
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,033
What's up, Chuck?

156
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,451
Jim, what are you doing?

157
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:33,828
Nothing. Just talking.

158
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,746
Okay. Michael handed in
his two-week notice.

159
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,331
Did you also hand in your two-week...
I didn't.

160
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,707
No? Okay.

161
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,505
After you.
No, I'm staying.

162
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,589
Okay.

163
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,852
Do you want me to translate the
German instructions for you?

164
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,479
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the
same as the English instructions.

165
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,816
Typical American arrogance
that got us involved

166
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,110
in a war we never
should have been in.

167
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,571
That's a really...
World War ll.

168
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:14,410
Well, fine, did the German instructions
say what this is supposed to do?

169
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,873
Let me see here.

170
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,126
That is either
an incense dispenser

171
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,754
or a ceremonial

172
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,258
sarcophagus.
Hmm.

173
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:33,095
My German is preindustrial
and mostly religious.

174
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,642
Pam, listen.

175
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,812
This order form, instead of
saying Dunder Mifflin at the top,

176
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,939
is there any way I could get
it to say something else?

177
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,858
Like Michael Scott
Paper Company?

178
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,568
You...

179
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,529
Somebody's been talking in bed.
Pillow talk.

180
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,740
Yeah. Listen, Michael.

181
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,283
Have you really
thought this through?

182
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,993
'Cause it's
a pretty big risk.

183
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,954
This is a dream

184
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,625
that I have had since lunch and
I am not giving up on it now.

185
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,003
Yeah. You could give
it up, though, right?

186
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,671
And almost no one would know.

187
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,550
Before you got here, I'm the one
who landed all of these clients.

188
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,052
Half of them. At least.

189
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,054
I can do it again.
I know the market.

190
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,555
I know the price points.

191
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,973
I'm on it. Don't worry.

192
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,809
So, how do I do that?

193
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,145
Well,

194
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,358
you can scan it, and then
you can upload the image,

195
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,484
and then you can
copy a new image...

196
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,568
Could I take a piece of paper

197
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,821
and just tape it
with transparent tape?

198
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,158
Yeah. Good.

199
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,452
Thank you very much.

200
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,996
So that is why I have to
leave at 5:00 on Tuesdays.

201
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,707
It's to pick up my little
sisters from school.

202
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,043
We're really tight.
We're like the Kardashians.

203
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,045
You know, you can run
this stuff by Toby.

204
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,338
Yeah, I don't like talking...

205
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,756
Come in.
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,758
I didn't realize
you were with anyone.

207
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,427
But I just wanted to bring you the
brochure on that accounting seminar

208
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,513
that I was telling
you about earlier.

209
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,265
Okay, we're in the middle
of something, Angela, so...

210
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,226
Actually, you know,
it was so much fun last year.

211
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,769
There was a sundae bar.

212
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,062
I mean,
I didn't have any.

213
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,855
You know,
to stay trim.

214
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,192
Did Michael just let
anybody in his office?

215
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,902
Yes. He loved to
facilitate communication.

216
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,529
He loved it. He invited
us in all the time.

217
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,572
He was, like, "Come in."
Yeah.

218
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,492
I am aware of the effect
I have on women.

219
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,370
So you should be heading
back to your desk.

220
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,498
Okay. Bye, Charles.

221
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,834
Well, you'll let me know.
Goodbye.

222
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,422
She's such
a special person.

223
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,549
She's turning 50 this year.

224
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,802
I'm starting
my own paper company.

225
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,554
No way!
Yeah.

226
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,390
In this climate?

227
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,641
In all climates.

228
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,601
It's going to be worldwide.

229
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,646
And I'm looking for some
talented salesmen to join me.

230
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,523
That's where you come in.

231
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:56,113
Well, it's a very intriguing
concept, isn't it?

232
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,413
Michael is starting
his own paper company.

233
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,207
What do you think
about that?

234
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,336
Your own paper company?

235
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,837
Can you believe it?
Well, we'll see.

236
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,088
We'll see.
Wow.

237
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,549
It's just a... It's a nugget
of an idea right now.

238
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,675
Right.

239
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,719
Potential.
Lots of potential. Yes.

240
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,139
What a courageous venture.

241
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,933
It's very courageous
and very exciting.

242
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,227
Location is hard for me
with the farm...

243
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,395
That's what
I was thinking.

244
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,439
...and the responsibilities, so...
That's what I was thinking.

245
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,816
With the farm. You getting to wherever...
It's so crucial...

246
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,943
...I'm gonna put my thing.

247
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,653
Okay.
So, think about it.

248
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,821
Yeah.
Let's put a pin in it for now.

249
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,407
You know, I would love
to put a pin in that.

250
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,618
Everyone, can I have
your attention?

251
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,829
This is the moment you've
all been waiting for.

252
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,498
Right?

253
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,542
Little Miss Thing
wants attention.

254
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,211
Thanks, Meredith.

255
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,300
Oh!

256
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,302
So...

257
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,263
G-44.

258
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,477
It's not ready, Kevin!

259
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,355
I am at a crucial point where
I have sunk four hours

260
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,065
into that copier.

261
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,527
And I am not gonna let it beat me
like that wireless router did.

262
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,912
You put a note in my food?
I made it sterile.

263
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,414
Just saying sterile
doesn't make it so.

264
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,209
I am offering you the opportunity
of a lifetime, Oscar,

265
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,877
to come work for me.

266
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,754
Do you have
a business plan?

267
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,173
A funding request, market
research, financials...

268
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,258
No, no, no!

269
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,342
You need those things...

270
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,969
Most new businesses,

271
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,721
they don't make a profit
till at least two years.

272
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,433
And then your margins
will be razor-thin.

273
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,684
Best-case scenario,

274
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,936
you don't cut yourself a salary
for at least five years.

275
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,771
Can you go five years
without a salary, Michael?

276
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,189
Okay.
Five years?

277
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,315
You already have the job.

278
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,692
You don't have
to convince me.

279
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,485
It's just not prudent,
Michael.

280
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,570
Stanley.

281
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,863
Can't you see
I'm urinating?

282
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,532
Listen. Listen, Stanley, you
don't need to answer me now.

283
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,616
No.

284
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,993
Just... I want you
to think about it.

285
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,369
I am starting
my own company.

286
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,454
No.

287
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,122
Okay, you're not
letting me finish.

288
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,665
And you just lost out
on a million dollars.

289
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,750
No, I didn't.

290
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,335
You know what?

291
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,463
I had a great time at prom.

292
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,841
And no one said yes
to that, either.

293
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,010
How's it working?

294
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,721
Let's see.

295
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,806
Yeah, it's fine.

296
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,266
Good.

297
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,019
I did it. I learned everything
about this machine.

298
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,105
I know all the buttons.
Even the inside ones.

299
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,359
I know all the error messages.
I could do a bound book

300
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,196
in plastic
with offset colors,

301
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,907
which feels...

302
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,000
Hey, Hank.

303
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,168
You ready?
Yeah.

304
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,252
Okay.

305
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,214
Michael?

306
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,715
I can't pretend
I haven't seen that.

307
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,093
So I'm gonna ask you
to stand up, walk out

308
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,637
and you can't
take anything.

309
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,679
Okay.

310
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,847
I have immunity.
It's my two weeks.

311
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:09,932
Not if you're starting

312
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,975
a competing paper
company, Michael.

313
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,769
Hank.

314
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,896
Okay, Michael.
Hank?

315
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,649
You really think Hank is
going to be loyal to you?

316
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,777
Hank, please escort Charles
from the building.

317
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,949
Come on, man, let's go.

318
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,787
I always thought
Michael got a bad rap.

319
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,456
He's a good guy.
And he's super funny.

320
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,919
Yeah, maybe I should
tell him before he goes.

321
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,506
He's all the way over there.

322
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,263
Well, here we are.
I would just like to...

323
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,889
No. No, no, no.

324
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,724
You're done, Michael.

325
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,151
All right then, everybody,
I'm out of here!

326
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,072
What is he doing?

327
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,157
It looks like
he's saying something.

328
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,286
I think he's singing.

329
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,788
I can't believe this
is really happening.

330
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,375
And I feel free!

331
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,757
And just like that, as
mysteriously as he arrived,

332
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,676
he was gone.

333
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,815
The whole office
feels darker.

334
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,775
You know?

335
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,821
It's just a sad, dark day.

336
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,656
Andy, he's gone.

337
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,907
I know.

338
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,201
You don't have to
kiss his ass anymore.

339
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,288
Michael's like
a movie on a plane.

340
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,166
You know, it's not great,
but it's something to watch.

341
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,834
And then when it's over,
you're, like,

342
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,919
how much time is left
on this flight?

343
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,671
You know. Now what?

344
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,097
Michael?

345
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,017
Don't look down.
Look straight up.

346
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,777
Come on. Please.

347
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,362
These are for employees only.

348
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,696
Angela, Kevin,
help me out.

349
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,865
I just need a few things,
and then I'll be gone.

350
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,992
Michael, why is it that
you asked everyone

351
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,162
except me, Angela,
Creed and Meredith?

352
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,581
I was going to.
I wanted to.

353
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,333
But I had to
start somewhere.

354
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,709
And you didn't want
to start with us?

355
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,835
No.

356
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,672
Of course not.
But now I want everybody.

357
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,132
Jim.

358
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,219
Buddy.

359
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,430
Buddy. Jimbo.

360
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,976
Did you have time to
think about my offer?

361
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,520
I did have a chance
to think about it,

362
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,813
but then I thought
about something else.

363
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,064
So, which way
are you leaning?

364
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,109
Well, it is tempting, but I am
100% leaning towards passing.

365
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,193
That's...

366
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,945
Did anyone see
the client list

367
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,030
that Michael was supposed
to be working on?

368
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,156
No.

369
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,783
Okay, let me know
if you find it.

370
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,744
Okay.

371
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,544
Okay.

372
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,671
Okay,
we don't have much time.

373
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,297
Just act normal.

374
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,216
Don't look at me.
People, stop.

375
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,218
Don't look down. Don't look down.
He's gonna see me.

376
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,595
Not all the way up. Keep
them at a normal height.

377
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,306
Okay? This is not Michael
Scott talking right now.

378
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,892
This is your future. Hello.

379
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,853
I am your future.

380
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,564
You are older and
you are very happy now,

381
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,775
because you went with
Michael Scott, right?

382
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,695
So, everybody,
come on down.

383
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,365
And let's just crawl out of
here together, all right?

384
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,953
Come on! Are you doing
your best here?

385
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,165
Are you being the best
that you can be?

386
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,001
All right, everybody
who's gonna go with me,

387
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,794
I want you
to stomp your foot.

388
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,549
Okay.

389
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,885
All right. Come on.

390
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,429
Come on.

391
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,265
You're coming with me.
Come on, Phyllis.

392
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,020
Here we go.

393
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,355
Here we go.

394
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,858
Michael, get up.
Oh, God, okay.

395
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,276
All right, all right.
Time to go.

396
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,153
Time to go. Jim, let's go.
Come on.

397
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,446
Come on!
Michael!

398
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,489
What are you doing?

399
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,948
I think maybe Hank
should be here.

400
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,576
Hank? You know,
I don't need Hank.

401
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,620
You're gonna mess with me?
Is that what you're gonna do?

402
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,414
I'll tell you something, Charles.
I don't even care,

403
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,166
because I've got
nothing to lose.

404
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,126
Okay.
Oh, my God. No, God! No!

405
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,629
No. All right.
It's not worth it.

406
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,309
Oh, no.
What?

407
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,812
I'm going with him.

408
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,063
What? Pam.

409
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,481
I'm going!

410
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,526
Pam, you can't be serious.

411
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,820
Michael, wait!

412
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,114
I'm coming with you.

413
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,326
You are?

414
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,119
Yeah.

415
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,500
Okay. It's gonna be great.

416
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,587
Great. Except I don't want to
be a receptionist anymore.

417
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,131
Right.

418
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,092
Executive assistant.

419
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,260
Salesman.

420
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,513
All right. Okay.

421
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,598
Deal.
Deal.

422
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,475
Okay, well, Jim?

423
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Still no.

424
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,061
Okay.
Yeah.

425
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,771
Well, let's go.

426
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,898
All my stuff is
still upstairs.

427
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,400
Are people watching?

428
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,693
Probably.

429
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,697
Michael, it's not how you leave an office.
It's how you...

430
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,156
Jim, Jim, Jim.

431
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,200
We're having
a company meeting here.

432
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,495
I will bring all your stuff home.
Okay.

433
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,955
All right.
I'll see you later.

434
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,790
Bye.
See you later.

435
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,102
So, we had
a personnel change today.

436
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,812
Shouldn't affect
our day-to-day,

437
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,816
but until we get a new receptionist,
I want Kevin on the phones.

438
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,818
Phones?

439
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,321
Also, there's been
way too much wasting time.

440
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,572
So, Stanley?
Yes?

441
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,198
Yeah, I want you
on top of that.

442
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,701
Okay, I want you to be
my productivity czar.

443
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,161
Okay? Good.

444
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,080
Okay, that's it on my list.

445
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,083
So, no excuses, guys.
Let's get going, okay?
