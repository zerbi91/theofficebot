1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,602
It's Britney, bitch,
and I am back

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,646
in the form of
a new company,

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,148
the Michael Scott
Paper Company.

4
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,825
Okay.

5
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,410
Not going to make this one.

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,084
Love the hair.

7
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,964
- Morning, Michael.
- Hello.

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,551
They took away
my parking space,

9
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,344
but they can't
take away my pride.

10
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,980
I would like to invite you all to
come along with me on a journey.

11
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,198
Welcome

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,785
to the Michael Scott
Paper Company.

13
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,743
So, I thought we could
take the customer list

14
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,203
and...

15
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,247
And we could...

16
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,792
You realize you're not
actually talking to me, right?

17
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,918
And...

18
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,461
Hey, Kelly.

19
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,506
Yes, Charles,
you wanted me.

20
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,883
Oh. No, I meant
that Kelly.

21
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,594
The new receptionist
is also named Kelly.

22
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,430
So Kelly Kapoor has decided
to hover around my desk

23
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,140
so that she can run
into Charles' office

24
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,600
every time
he calls for Kelly.

25
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,645
She thinks that if she says
"You wanted me" enough,

26
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,563
he will, in fact,
want her.

27
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,316
It's not the worst plan
she's ever had.

28
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,818
Oh, and Kelly...

29
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,362
Yes, Charles,
yes, you wanted me.

30
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,657
Okay, I'm going
to call you Kapoor,

31
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,408
okay, and you Hammond.

32
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,870
If we're changing names, can I be Erin?
It's my middle name.

33
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,039
Erin? Okay,
that's very pretty.

34
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,207
Thanks.

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,333
Well, you know what
my middle name is?

36
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,127
Rajnigandha. And I hate it.
I hate it!

37
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,299
I thought Rajnigandha
was a boy's name.

38
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,435
We are in the heart of it.

39
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:11,858
And the surge of water carries
our business out to the sea.

40
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,192
What should we do now?

41
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:18,030
We wait and hope that people
show up to the pancake luncheon.

42
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,866
I don't know. I think
I have done absolutely

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,285
everything you can do
to prepare for the day.

44
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,370
I've updated
our contacts,

45
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,455
I have gotten quotes
from suppliers,

46
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,000
I have sent out an Evite

47
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,836
for our big grand opening
pancake luncheon.

48
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,464
Six yeses, one maybe,
only 11 nos.

49
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,719
And 788 not-yet-replieds,

50
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,472
but of that group,
782 have viewed it.

51
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:49,562
I'm going to need
800 of these

52
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,231
on nice bright paper.

53
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,484
It is a coupon for
unparalleled customer service.

54
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,662
I make that one copy and I become
the girl who makes copies.

55
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,957
And by the end of the day,
I'm receptionist again.

56
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,793
And the worst part is
I like making copies.

57
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,838
The paper comes out
all warm and stuff.

58
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,175
And it's cold in there, because
it's technically a closet.

59
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,017
What do you think?

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,310
Let me check.

61
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,064
No! Clearly a hunter,

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,942
who knows how to throw an
outfit together. Thank you.

63
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,361
Yes, I am taking Andy
hunting after work.

64
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,113
Not long ago we were
sexual competitors.

65
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,866
I used to hate him, hate
him, hate him, hate him.

66
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,328
I studied him to figure out
why I hated him so much.

67
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:52,375
But that blossomed into a very real
friendship, as these things often do.

68
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,503
You should come in town
this weekend, man. Yeah.

69
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,213
We'll hang out Scranton-style.
Hey.

70
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,048
You said you were going to
be out of town this weekend.

71
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,175
Please don't listen
to my phone calls.

72
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,553
Yeah, she's, like...

73
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,058
She'd probably be a six in New York, but
she's like a seven here in Scranton.

74
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,477
And then the boss is my old
boss from Dunder Mifflin.

75
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,981
It's a small space.

76
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,191
Hey, Jim,
can I get a, um...

77
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,235
Hi.
Hi.

78
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,821
I need a rundown of your clients.
Can you get that to me?

79
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,863
Sure.
Yeah?

80
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,365
Yeah.
Okay.

81
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,494
What the hell
is a rundown?

82
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,456
When did you need
that rundown by?

83
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,916
Soon as possible.
Okay.

84
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,086
Just get it right.
Yeah, gotcha. Of course.

85
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,839
Really dive into
the rundown.

86
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,008
I'll be exhausted, because
it's like a triathlon.

87
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,260
Did you want
to close this?

88
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,803
Keep it...

89
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,146
You know there's a ghost
in this office.

90
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,565
Really? A woman was
murdered on this very floor

91
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,150
in 1816.

92
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,819
Haddy McGonigal.
She was a prostitute.

93
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,363
Why was she
in this building?

94
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,991
This whole place
used to be a brothel.

95
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,909
There was a tavern
on the ground floor.

96
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,370
That's crazy.
Yeah, isn't it?

97
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,457
She was bludgeoned to death by the
business end of a riding crop.

98
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,667
Oh, my God.
It was gruesome.

99
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,296
They say she walks
these hallways.

100
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,965
If you ever feel a tapping
on your shoulder,

101
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,467
that could be Haddy,

102
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,343
begging for her life.

103
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,305
And it could mean
that you're next.

104
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,395
Just kidding.
You finding everything okay?

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,397
Yeah. Just got some ice.
Yeah.

106
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,985
Erin. Erin.

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,987
Oh. This is awkward.

108
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,991
Uh-oh.

109
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,618
Oh.

110
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,827
Oh!

111
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,290
So, I'll see you
guys around.

112
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,299
Hey, buddy.

113
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,681
Hey, Ryan, could you get
to that copy from before?

114
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,266
Pam's better
at that stuff.

115
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,684
That is so insulting.

116
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,187
How is it insulting to say
that you're good at something?

117
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,688
Because the thing
you're saying I'm good at

118
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,024
is pushing a big green
button a bunch of times.

119
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,610
I'm not judging it.
It's like,

120
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,030
I could run GM,
but I couldn't fix a car.

121
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,282
It's not saying that
one's better than the other.

122
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,953
Seriously? Because it sounds like one
of those is better than the other.

123
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:35,955
What the hell?

124
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,748
Listen, listen, listen!

125
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,292
I need somebody to make
a copy of this,

126
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,253
because I don't make
copies, I'm the boss.

127
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,462
Got it?

128
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,423
I make originals.
Yeah, I make originals, too.

129
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,301
Shut up! Stop it, stop it!
Bickering, stop it!

130
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,762
Really.
Yeah.

131
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,932
Not much.
What's up with you?

132
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,893
No, it's okay,
I'm in the bathroom.

133
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,064
Hey, you been watching Damages this year?
It's been so good.

134
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,068
No, you gotta tune in. It's
as good as anything on HBO.

135
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,240
Hey, does blue
go with tan?

136
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,700
Would somebody
just make the copy?

137
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,245
Like a blue shirt.
I don't wear a lot of colors.

138
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,663
I have a lot of tan.

139
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,332
Uh-huh.

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,501
Just make the copy, okay?

141
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,515
Seriously? This is
what's so important.

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,017
Putting naked pictures
on the desktop.

143
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,852
That's me and my friend
Jasmine from Thailand.

144
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,979
I don't want to look at your
friend Jasmine's boobs all day.

145
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,232
You could be hot, too, if
you made any effort at all.

146
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,151
Like how?
Dying my hair blond?

147
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,862
This is from the sun.
Oh, yeah, I bet.

148
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,032
They're getting on my nerves, Mom.
Both of them.

149
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,533
R thinks he's too good
to be here

150
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,911
and P is not as much fun
without Jim.

151
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,037
Michael, we can hear you.

152
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,955
I'm on the phone, please.

153
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,585
Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back.
P's being a giant B.

154
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,587
Okay, it's my turn.

155
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,005
No, don't take that,
give that back.

156
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,048
Go make the copies.
Give it back for what?

157
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,174
What are you going
to do with it?

158
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,508
You're gonna make
another spreadsheet.

159
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,345
Yeah, exactly, it's my turn, come on!
Go make the copies, secretary.

160
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,306
Ryan! They always say
that it is a mistake

161
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,934
to hire your friends
and they are right.

162
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,728
So, I hired
my best friends.

163
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,688
And this is what I get?

164
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,734
Hey, buddy.
What are you up to?

165
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,195
Hmm. Nothing.

166
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,616
Listen, when I saw you
talking to Erin earlier,

167
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,078
I noticed that your pupils
dilated and your skin flushed,

168
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:43,123
and I'm assuming a little bit of
blood rushed into your penis.

169
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,006
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into
mine as well, so where does that leave us?

170
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,096
The last thing I want to do
is step on your funk, man.

171
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,058
And I yours,
so I will cede her to you.

172
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,602
No, that's ridiculous.
No, no, no.

173
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,729
Look, you've been here
longer and, besides,

174
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,856
I'm a better wingman
than I am a boyfriend,

175
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,025
so... But I just want
you and I to hang out.

176
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,777
You know, just...

177
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,363
Boom.

178
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,032
Listen up.

179
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,456
It has come to my attention

180
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,166
that some people
in this office

181
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,837
are not getting along with
other people in this office.

182
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,381
And I think I have come up
with the reason why.

183
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,718
This office space
is too small.

184
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,344
Definitely.
Okay.

185
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,307
There are four corners
in this room.

186
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,936
Each corner is to be a personal
space for each one of you.

187
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,189
Whichever corner you want,
and make it your own.

188
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,482
We could work from home.

189
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,443
Or you could fire
one of us.

190
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,944
Whoever has
less education.

191
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,155
Okay, guys,
thank you for the offers,

192
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,115
but I want you to get pumped
about this corner idea.

193
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,493
All right, one, two, three,
what are we going to do?

194
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,871
Corner idea.
No, you're supposed to say,

195
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,372
"Rock the house."
Rock the house.

196
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,582
How would we know that?

197
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,294
Hey, dude, do you know
what a rundown is?

198
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,088
Use it in a sentence.

199
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,256
Uh...

200
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,675
Can you get this
rundown for me?

201
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,218
Try another sentence.

202
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,054
This rundown better
be really good.

203
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,348
I don't know, but it sounds like
the rundown is really important.

204
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,600
Charles asked me to do this
rundown of all my clients.

205
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,226
Why don't you just
ask him what it...

206
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,270
No, I can't,
that was like hours ago.

207
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,938
What have you been doing?

208
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,857
Try another sentence.

209
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,693
Last night
was crazy.

210
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,987
Jojo? Yeah.

211
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,865
He did a doughnut in the
parking lot in front of a cop.

212
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,408
Then he yells, "Hey, cop,
you like doughnuts?"

213
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,077
And we drive off.

214
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,204
No, he just
stayed there.

215
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,915
I want that new phone.

216
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,167
No, the other one.

217
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,419
No, the other one. No, you know
which one I'm talking about.

218
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,046
It's the one...

219
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,631
No, the one with
the awesome browser.

220
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,135
That's my corner.

221
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,762
I thought that
was your corner.

222
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,056
No, this is where I work.

223
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,725
I can't relax in the
same corner where I work.

224
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,187
So my corner's the one
with the copier?

225
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,023
Pam, I don't make
the rules.

226
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,989
I wish my iPod
could make phone calls.

227
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,867
No, I don't want an iPhone.
I know what an iPhone is.

228
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,126
You started on that
rundown yet?

229
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,756
Oh, this is just something
I'm taking a break with. Oh.

230
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,592
I will get back to
the rundown right now.

231
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,511
Okay, great.
Hey, you know what?

232
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,138
Do you have a rundown
that I could take a look at,

233
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,557
just so I know what type of
rundown you're looking for?

234
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,642
Just keep it simple. Keeping it
simple, that's what I'm doing.

235
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,352
But I am working
hard on this one.

236
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,729
Real hard, so...
You're working hard? On this?

237
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,567
No, not too hard,
not harder than I should.

238
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,278
Right, I mean, why work
harder than you should?

239
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,030
No, I...

240
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,414
Can I help you?
No, thanks.

241
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,957
Hey. Hey, I'm here
to see Charles.

242
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,167
Okay.

243
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,627
Hey, Charles.
Hey, Pam.

244
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,422
I know you're a very busy man,
so I'll cut right to the chase.

245
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,883
Okay.
I'd like my old job back.

246
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,010
I don't know what to tell you.
The job's been taken.

247
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,224
Well, I could come back as a salesman.
I have experience now.

248
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,478
Or I could come back
as your personal assistant.

249
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,480
You know, sort your mail,
set your appointments.

250
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,607
I know all the people.
Yeah, no.

251
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,650
Personal shopper?

252
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,902
No.

253
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,405
Well, it was great
catching up with you,

254
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,656
and I'll see you
around the building.

255
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,741
Okay.

256
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,454
I'm just going to sit here for a
little bit longer if that's okay.

257
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,373
The air smells so good.

258
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,168
I don't remember it
smelling so good.

259
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,046
Chairs are so comfortable.

260
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,930
Oh, hey, Stanley,
Phyllis, come on in.

261
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,766
Welcome, welcome.
Let me give you the tour.

262
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,185
I get it.
You need to see more?

263
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,436
It's really cute.

264
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,271
Thank you.
Do you remember Ryan?

265
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,401
And Pam,
around here somewhere.

266
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,570
She's upstairs
talking to Charles.

267
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,949
What for?
I don't know.

268
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,577
Are we staying
until 5:00?

269
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,037
Yes.

270
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:38,001
Maybe the Michael Scott Paper
Company was a huge mistake.

271
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,756
I should leave.
I should go

272
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,218
and start my own paper company.
That'll show them.

273
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,641
Get your free pancakes.

274
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,311
They are delicious.
They are nutritious.

275
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,897
They are complimentary.

276
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,816
Young sir, would you
like a free pancake?

277
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,568
I'm texting. I don't want
to get my hands sticky.

278
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,071
Ryan, enough with the texting machine.
Come on.

279
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,490
Tuck in your shirt. You're
the face of this company.

280
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,246
Hey, Pam.
Hey.

281
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,415
You sort of disappeared there for a while.
Where you been?

282
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,750
Yeah, I needed to take
care of some stuff. Yeah?

283
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,502
That's as specific
as I'd like to be.

284
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,505
Well, at least you're still
being honest with me.

285
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,970
There's the rundown
you asked for.

286
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,222
I may have expanded some areas
that you weren't prepared for...

287
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,933
Great, fax that to everyone
on the distribution list.

288
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,185
Uh, sure.

289
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,647
Do you want to look at it first?
Do I need to?

290
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,941
No. No, I just...

291
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,904
Wanted to make sure
we have the same format.

292
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,784
So that distribution list
is going to be my...

293
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,954
What's that? The one I have.
I'll use the one I have.

294
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,629
Just faxing my dad a rundown.

295
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,050
We're small, but we're eager
to make a name for ourselves.

296
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,510
Do you have a card?

297
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,598
No, I don't have a card,
but I'll do you one better.

298
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,808
A little scrap of paper.

299
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,480
These are terrible, boss.

300
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,316
You got to make them in a circle,
so that they cook evenly.

301
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,651
They're shaped
like paper.

302
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,569
Well, I don't even
want these.

303
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,574
I'll take them
for my kid.

304
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,088
Country roads,
take me home

305
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,589
To the place...

306
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,258
Sorry, I like that song.
You're good.

307
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,344
You're good.
Thank you.

308
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,971
That was great,
but it's just sort of...

309
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,641
It's still a little choppy, like...
But don't worry, it's hard, I mean,

310
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,184
it took me a while, too.
It's like...

311
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,609
Wow.

312
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,069
What?

313
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,196
Oh, my God, you heard that?
I'm so embarrassed.

314
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,657
I'm so, like, rusty. It's good,
you're really coming along.

315
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,075
It's really technically
proficient,

316
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,369
but, you know, there's really
no heart or soul in it.

317
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,620
Really?

318
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,593
Hey, do you want
to sing it with me?

319
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,804
Almost heaven

320
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,014
West Virginia
West Virginia

321
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,935
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River

322
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,145
In German!

323
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:55,824
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads

324
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,287
To the place I belong
To the place I belong

325
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:04,499
West Virginia, mountain momma
West Virginia, mountain momma

326
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,545
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads

327
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,130
Take it, Andy!

328
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,676
Take me home to the place

329
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,016
You have to stop.

330
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,404
I once had a dream

331
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,492
that I was eating a peanut
butter and tuna fish sandwich,

332
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,495
and let me tell you
something, it was delicious.

333
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,248
So, the next day, I decided
to make that sandwich.

334
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,293
And in real life
it is disgusting.

335
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,129
It is a disgusting sandwich.

336
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,174
And the reason
I tell you this story...

337
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,135
Pick up the phone. Just...

338
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,974
Dunder... Michael Scott
Paper Company, this is Pam.

339
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,604
Oh. Hi, Russell from the
pancake luncheon, how are you?

340
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,900
Well, we'd like to do
business with you, too.

341
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,069
How can I make that happen?

342
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,364
Keep going. Tell him
we have free delivery.

343
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,740
We already offer
free delivery.

344
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,325
They don't know that.

345
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,788
I can offer you free delivery on
any order that you place today.

346
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,914
God.

347
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,294
Okay, 20 boxes, I can do...
Just a second.

348
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,549
I can do 20 boxes
at $43 a box.

349
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,552
Great.

350
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,345
Write it down.

351
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,513
Give him a guarantee.

352
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,431
A guarantee of what?
Just say the word.

353
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:48,019
And I guarantee that
you will be satisfied,

354
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,148
because your satisfaction
is our guarantee.

355
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,942
We guarantee it.

356
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,570
We look forward to doing
business with you, too.

357
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,696
Thank you, Russell.

358
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,364
Yes!
I made a sale!

359
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,449
You did! Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God.

360
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,618
We did it!
She did it! Yeah!

361
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,996
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

362
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,789
Who would have thought
that the thing that

363
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,792
would save this company
would be work?

364
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:11,877
And pancakes.

365
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,882
In the end, this day definitely
had its ups and downs.

366
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,010
I realize that we don't
have the biggest office,

367
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:24,180
which is a surprise, because 165
square feet sounds like a lot.

368
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,934
But we have people
with the biggest hearts,

369
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,270
and I think
for a small company,

370
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,563
that is really...

371
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,609
Someone went
to the bathroom.

372
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,780
That is really
what's important.

373
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,411
Literally every song is better a cappella.
Name a song.

374
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,330
Cherry Pie, Warrant.
Better a cappella.

375
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,832
No, really?
Yeah, name another.

376
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,169
Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Better a cappella.

377
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,004
Rebel Yell, Billy Idol.

378
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,881
Way better a cappella.

379
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,633
Really?
Yeah.
