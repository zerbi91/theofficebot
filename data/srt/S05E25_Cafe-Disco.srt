1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:05,129
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,090
I just won
an art contest.

3
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,766
Thanks.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,934
I still don't
understand why you

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,352
- wanted me to say that.
- Shut up.

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,647
I got her.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,609
Not cool, Dwight.

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,861
Not cool, man.

9
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,859
Oh, no.

10
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,028
I still have the lease on the
Michael Scott Paper Company,

11
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:16,409
so occasionally, I will sneak down
here for a little coffee and dancing.

12
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,829
I actually dance
all the time.

13
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:24,041
Tip-toeing around
corporate, it is a ballet.

14
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:28,212
When I am breaking all the
rules, I'm break dancing.

15
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,840
And espresso.

16
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,719
Guys, I'm scared.
I'm really scared.

17
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,471
I think I'm growing
into a giant,

18
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,265
because look at this
normal-sized coffee cup.

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,226
Looks so tiny in
my giant hand now.

20
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,980
Anybody want to go to
lunch with me later on?

21
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,900
I do. Okay, how about a woman?
Pam?

22
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,569
I can't do lunch. I was
just sending you an e-mail.

23
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,030
Jim and I need to leave early today
to meet with our contractor.

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,948
Really? Okay.

25
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,116
Just sent it.

26
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,743
What about
the rest of you?

27
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,329
At Dunder Mifflin,

28
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:05,458
there is a very strict
no-lunch-with-the-boss policy,

29
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,251
and I don't know
who instituted it.

30
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,005
I think it started right after
my predecessor stepped down.

31
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,715
But at the Michael
Scott Paper Company,

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,219
I really enjoyed having lunch
with Pam and Ryan every day.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,515
So, rules be damned, I want to
have lunch with these people.

34
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,099
Who else?
Who else? Ryan?

35
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,519
I don't do lunch. I'm doing
five small meals a day now.

36
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,313
Now that I'm back to doing
the job of a temp again,

37
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,358
I find that food is one
thing I can control.

38
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,986
Okay, anyone?
Anyone at all?

39
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,616
Accounting, I am a-counting on
you to go to lunch with me.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,327
No, I don't want to stay late
to have a two-hour lunch.

41
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,162
Michael, we have
a lot of work to do.

42
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,372
What?

43
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:45,998
Work.

44
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,210
God. What happened
to you people?

45
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,837
"We are
just office drones.

46
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:55,132
"We are office drones.
All we do is work. Is work."

47
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,344
If you don't take out his battery,
he just keeps going all day.

48
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,680
Oh, no, your
battery fell out.

49
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,893
"I was just
learning to love."

50
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,690
Hi, guys.
How are you doing?

51
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,025
Erin, how many times
do I have to tell you?

52
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,194
It is not necessary for you
to ask us how we are doing

53
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,445
every time you
interact with us.

54
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,905
You're right.
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,784
Now, how can I help you?

56
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,329
Did somebody here leave a map in
the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?

57
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:31,711
Attention, office. Who here is
planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio?

58
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,089
I will take your silence to mean
that you are all hiding something.

59
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,092
This location is
the superior court...

60
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,261
So someone's going
to a court. Big deal.

61
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,221
It is a big deal, 'cause there's
only a handful of reasons

62
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,557
why someone would ever go
to a courthouse in Ohio

63
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,475
and not be charged with a crime.

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,811
Claim an inheritance
from a deceased relative,

65
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,607
to obtain a learner's permit
at age 14 1/2 instead of 15.

66
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,860
Erin, let me see
your birth certificate.

67
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,486
Sure.

68
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,489
There are other
reasons to go to Ohio.

69
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,616
We're getting
married today.

70
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,703
So, it turns out it's the closest
place to get a marriage license

71
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,829
without a three-day
waiting period.

72
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:07,914
Tell them how it happened.

73
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,582
Okay, so we're going through
all the wedding plans,

74
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,417
and, boy,
it is complicated.

75
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,501
And very expensive.

76
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,586
Very expensive.

77
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,879
'Cause you say you
want a small wedding

78
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,923
and that's great,
but then you have to...

79
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,758
You can't leave anyone out.
No one.

80
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,384
Okay, just get
to the good part.

81
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,346
Right, so, this morning, we are
having breakfast together...

82
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,430
Mmm-hmm.

83
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,225
...and I just looked up
from my cereal and I said,

84
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,064
"You know what I want to do today?
I want to marry you."

85
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,692
I had just woken up.
I didn't look cute.

86
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,819
That's how I
knew he meant it.

87
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,197
Michael?

88
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,533
Michael, sorry to bother you. Are
you going to be working down here?

89
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,618
Do you want
these down here...

90
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,244
No work! No work! No work!

91
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,080
I come here to
release frustration.

92
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,751
Well, I like to swim.
That's good.

93
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,003
You've got a
cool place to come.

94
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,215
If you ever want to come down
here, door's always open.

95
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,466
Lock's broken, so...

96
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,550
Thank you.

97
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,595
Give me your hand. Hey, here
we go, here we go. Yeah.

98
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,056
There we go. Now you got it.
Now I do got it.

99
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,808
Now you got it. Hey, you
want some espresso?

100
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,976
Yeah.

101
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Gotta keep
yourself dehydrated.

102
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,895
That's rule number one. Okay.

103
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,814
I love it.
I love it.

104
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:21,237
Guys, I believe that I have figured
out what is up your butts.

105
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,990
There's no reason
to be scared.

106
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,367
The bad man is gone.
Charles is gone.

107
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,994
Charles really did
a number on these guys.

108
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,996
They are way too
focused on work.

109
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,834
When I was in charge, this place
was like Dave & Buster's,

110
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,338
people just hanging out,
having fun, eating apps.

111
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:44,176
I don't know, it's like
Dave died or something.

112
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,014
Daddy's here, and Daddy is
going to take care of you.

113
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,849
Please don't refer to
yourself as our daddy.

114
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:56,022
I am your big daddy, and I am
going to kiss the boo-boo.

115
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,524
Little
Andy is afraid.

116
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,859
Andy's afraid?
Yes.

117
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,527
Are you all afraid?
No.

118
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,531
Daddy's here for you,
my little angels.

119
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,324
Okay,

120
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,870
I think that I have figured a way
to get you guys out of your funk.

121
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,955
What?
Funk is the problem,

122
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,041
and the solution.
That makes sense.

123
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,542
I have taken my
downstairs office

124
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,878
and I have turned it
into a place to hang out,

125
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,215
a place where unattractive and
attractive people can get together,

126
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,428
to meet, to greet, to see
the ones that you love,

127
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,722
to love the ones
that you see.

128
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,183
Is this our punishment for not
wanting to have lunch with you?

129
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,101
Why don't you get
over lunch, Oscar?

130
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,227
Everybody else is past it.

131
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:39,190
All work and no play
makes Michael a dull boy.

132
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,983
This is like a haunted
coffee house thing?

133
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,820
No, Dwight is confusing you.
It's more of a disco.

134
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,072
It's like a haunted disco.

135
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,574
With coffee, but
without the haunting.

136
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,868
It's a combo dance
house-coffee bar.

137
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,580
It is a daytime disco
on the ground floor

138
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,207
of an industrial
office building.

139
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,333
It's a Cafe Disco.

140
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,417
Exactly.

141
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,127
Like a disco-cafe.

142
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,547
What? No. No.
Not even close.

143
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,884
I can't force you to go
down, but I can entice you.

144
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,095
I'm going to
be down there.

145
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,013
Erin will be down there
from time to time,

146
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,641
and all-you-can-eat espresso.

147
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,942
Well, Kevin, I guess
it is just me and you.

148
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,944
Yeah.
Holding down the fort.

149
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,613
Yeah. This place is great.

150
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,739
Thank you.

151
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,659
Oh, my God, Kevin,
I am still on hold.

152
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,743
You were supposed
to get the answer

153
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:33,953
from Michael
and come back up.

154
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,456
This is a no-work zone.
Please respect the lei.

155
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,417
Yeah, respect the lei.

156
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,837
Come.

157
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,255
Kevin, stay.

158
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,756
Kevin, come.

159
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,299
Kevin, stay.

160
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,802
Kevin, come.
Stay, stay.

161
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,680
Come on, right now.
Cookie, Kevin. Cookie.

162
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,724
There is
no cookie, Kevin.

163
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,601
Is there a cookie?
Mmm-hmm.

164
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,271
Come on.

165
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,649
For goodness sakes,
Kevin, there's no cookie.

166
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,652
There's no cookie.
Come on. Come.

167
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,362
I wanted a cookie.

168
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,114
Completely unacceptable.

169
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,952
Now I know what the founders
of Philip Morris felt like.

170
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:21,709
You just want to give people
a smooth, fun way to relax,

171
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,714
and suddenly, you're just
some terrible monster.

172
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,347
Here we go.

173
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,501
What the hell!

174
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,215
Hi, Jessica,
is Bob in?

175
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,382
He's on a call.

176
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,467
Well, I'll just
duck my head in.

177
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,303
It's pretty important. He
wouldn't want to be disturbed.

178
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,764
Can I give him a message
before he gets off?

179
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,225
Tell him I'm going
dancing downstairs

180
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,935
in the storage closet
between the bathrooms

181
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,063
that used to be a utility shower,
and he should join me there.

182
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,397
I'll let him know.

183
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,149
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,155
Phyllis?

185
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,990
Hi.

186
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,743
Hey.
Hey,

187
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,869
I like.

188
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,714
All right. Back... There you go.
There you go. You got it.

189
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,051
Show me some attitude.

190
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,930
Mother.

191
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,807
God. No, no, no.

192
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,933
Back.

193
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,935
Wow, what did you do?

194
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,272
You didn't do that.
You're okay.

195
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,399
You're okay.
Let's lie down.

196
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,025
Give me... You want
to go down? All right.

197
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,819
Sorry.

198
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,779
Okay, that's okay.

199
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,991
Backs are a problem.
Okay, sweetie...

200
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,117
Right here.

201
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,459
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I got your text.
Who's Phillip?

202
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,919
No, no, no.

203
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,629
Who tipped you over?
Was it Phillip?

204
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,714
It's my back.

205
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,840
It's her back.
We just... We need...

206
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,924
God, call a doctor.

207
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,342
You know what? We're going
to take care of you.

208
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,136
We're going to get you help.
Come on, come on.

209
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,345
Call Bob.

210
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,513
No, no, no,
this is no good.

211
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,640
Yeah, back
injuries are common.

212
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,808
Not as common
as knee injuries,

213
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,934
but more common
than wrist injuries.

214
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,311
I don't need a
history lesson, okay?

215
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,562
What do you
think history is?

216
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,022
Just... We need to
get her out of there

217
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,024
because no one is going
to want to go in there

218
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,234
with a woman writhing
around on the floor.

219
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,737
Wait, wait, wait,
but most importantly,

220
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,324
we need to get her some
medical attention ASAP, stat.

221
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,700
Here we go.
Here we go.

222
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,243
Ramming speed.

223
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,120
Okay, out of the way.
Move it or lose it.

224
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,331
Oh, my God, what happened? You
having fun taking a little ride?

225
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,790
Just having
too much fun.

226
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,168
Phyllis, we're gonna put you in here.
Dwight's gonna take care of you.

227
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,670
What? No, I thought we were
going to the hospital.

228
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,213
If you want to get sick,
you go to a hospital.

229
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,633
Okay, Dwight.
Okay, good.

230
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,385
I do not want
anybody to worry.

231
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,636
What happened
to Phyllis?

232
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,431
You know,
nothing. She's...

233
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,059
We were hanging
out at Cafe Disco

234
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,852
and she had a flare-up
of an existing injury,

235
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,437
but she's a
tough old bird, so...

236
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,855
Can you please
go back to work

237
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,857
instead of masterminding
these situations

238
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,233
wherein we
hurt ourselves?

239
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,444
Okay, fine. Phyllis
did injure herself,

240
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,613
but she injured
herself having fun,

241
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,366
and I don't think she would
trade that memory for anything.

242
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,370
I would like the
memory of a day

243
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,747
uninterrupted
by this nonsense.

244
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,626
You all took a life here today.
You did.

245
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,169
The life of the party.

246
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,298
Erin, I want you
to go downstairs,

247
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,801
and I want you
to shut it down.

248
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,636
You mean unplug the coffee
machine and bring it up here?

249
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,304
I don't care. Bury it.

250
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,723
I hope you're happy.

251
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,190
Okay. I'm going to need
two able-bodied men.

252
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,945
Cafe Disco? More
like crappy disco.

253
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,446
You're bad.

254
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,006
There's girls in there. Where?

255
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,591
The other room.
What other room?

256
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,427
Down the hall.
There's girls there?

257
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,594
What did I just say?

258
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,679
You bring my sandwich?

259
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,972
Forget the sandwich.

260
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,765
Girls. Girls.

261
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,439
I guess they got what they want.
I am eating alone.

262
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,775
Might as well be dinner.

263
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:05,534
Comfy? All right, all right.
Just relax, relax, okay?

264
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,454
Dwight. Dwight.

265
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,540
Come on, relax. This shirt
wasn't doing you any favors.

266
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,627
If my assessment is correct,
you grind your teeth?

267
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,879
I do.

268
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,009
No kidding. She sits three feet from me.
It's the most annoying thing.

269
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,096
It's like children
singing Christmas carols.

270
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,112
Yeah. I'm loving
the vibe down here.

271
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,114
Ashley. You made it.

272
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,910
You invited someone?

273
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,495
Oh. Yeah. Was I not
allowed to do that?

274
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,498
I don't know. I've been here
eight years, and I've never...

275
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,665
Rude.

276
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,344
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty
sure I'm in a dance-off.

277
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,310
Cafe Disco is dead, but I can
still hear the music in my head.

278
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,770
I hear it, too, boss.

279
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,416
It's better
than I imagined it.

280
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,170
It feels good, Dwight.

281
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,296
Tell me where it hurts.

282
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,633
Right... Right there.

283
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,553
Yeah, you've got
a knot in your crest.

284
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,430
This remedy has been passed down
in my family for generations,

285
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,266
and it always works.

286
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,645
My grandfather was told that Diamond
Dancer would never race again.

287
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,732
They were wrong. He came in
ninth in the Apple Creek Derby.

288
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,860
And his jerky came in
third the following year.

289
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,490
A majestic beast.
So fast, so tender.

290
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,913
Welcome, welcome. Cafe Disco.
I am Michael Scott.

291
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,206
Hey, Angela,
welcome to Cafe...

292
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,416
Stop!

293
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,877
Angela, Angela, Angela, may I
interest you in a triple espresso,

294
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,421
or perhaps a dance?

295
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,007
No, I didn't come down
here to get wet and wild.

296
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,216
I just need you
to sign these.

297
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,261
All right.
Here you go.

298
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,762
And, no, you need
to sign them all.

299
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,472
No, no, no.
Here is the deal.

300
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,933
One signature
for every song.

301
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,060
Look, I hate to
be "that" person,

302
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,438
but I just don't like the
general spirit of music.

303
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,900
I know, I know. Angela, a lot of
people doubted Cafe Disco at first,

304
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,529
but it is a magical place. You
have to give it a chance.

305
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,449
If these walls could
talk, they would say,

306
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,744
"This is a magical place.
You're safe here.

307
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,122
"We are talking walls.
We're not going to eat you."

308
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,209
No.

309
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,297
This is oil from
the gland of an otter.

310
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,550
It keeps their fur water
resistant, as well as traps heat.

311
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,385
Now, I need you to
lie still for an hour.

312
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,596
An hour? I can't
stay here an hour.

313
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,183
Whoa, whoa, girl.
Whoa. Whoa.

314
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,437
Boss, this used to hang from my
windshield, but it belongs in here.

315
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,398
Hey, thank you, Creed.
You really get this place.

316
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,402
No problem. I'll just have no
idea who's driving behind me now.

317
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,243
Look out.

318
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,625
Yeah!
Yeah.

319
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,212
Yeah!
Finish it off.

320
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,755
Oh, no! Oh, no!

321
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,471
Here we go. Okay,
something's gonna happen.

322
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,564
Here we go. Yeah.

323
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,376
I'm going to go
with the python.

324
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,211
But the rattler's so scary.

325
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,006
No, please, I find the rattle soothing.
Puts me to sleep.

326
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,968
I think Bob's going to cheat
on me with his new secretary.

327
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,017
What's so funny?

328
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,646
When I say it out
loud, it's so silly.

329
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,195
Hey, hey, Angela, no.
No cleaning up.

330
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,698
You are forcing me
to be down here.

331
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,324
Am I not allowed
to have some fun?

332
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,160
No cleaning up.

333
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,257
These are for you.

334
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,426
They're beautiful.

335
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,137
You ready?
Yeah.

336
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,533
We should probably stop by.
It would mean a lot to him.

337
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:47,083
Hey. Hey. Man,
Jim and Pam.

338
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,170
Can you believe this?
It's really happening.

339
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,714
Want to dance, Dwight?

340
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,508
Ordinarily,
I would say no,

341
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:58,011
but you need to move to
reduce lactic acid buildup.

342
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,931
Also, this song
is fantastic.

343
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,142
Mind if I steal my wife?

344
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,187
You can't steal what is
legally your property.

345
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,567
Are those staples?

346
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,695
This dance competition
is not over.

347
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,241
What dance competition? I was just
dancing casually with my friend, y'all.

348
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,742
Yeah, right.

349
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,635
You guys are the
best for coming.

350
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,971
You don't have to stay if you
don't want to. I understand.

351
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,722
We're going to stay.
Really?

352
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,766
At least for
one more dance.

353
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:49,062
No, not me. Not me. Get out of here.
Cafe Disco.

354
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,649
Hey, come on, man.
We're not even to "Y."

355
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,109
This is so cheesy.

356
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,318
Yes.

357
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,992
I like cheesy.

358
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,201
Me, too.

359
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:10,125
You know, I think maybe I
want a wedding wedding.

360
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,210
Me, too.

361
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,795
Really?
Yeah.

362
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,637
Would you like
to dance?

363
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,139
No.

364
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,692
Yeah. No, well, okay...
Stop squirming.

365
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,611
Well, stop trying to poke
me with a sharp thing.

366
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,738
You wanted to do this, okay?
Just be brave.

367
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,114
I know, but you're
not a professional,

368
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,699
and I'm thinking maybe we
should have gone that route.

369
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,367
I'm doing... No, I'm
doing it for free.

370
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,577
Just... You have
to stop squirming,

371
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,786
otherwise, I'm
going to mess up.

372
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,371
Are you sure that's
not the gay ear?

373
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,998
Gay ear?
Are you 12 years old?

374
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,124
Well, I...

375
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,417
Look, I'm going to
count to three.

376
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,501
Count to 20.

377
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,338
No, I'm going to count to three.
One, two, three.

378
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,923
Son of a bitch!

379
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,008
Andy, that was
just the ice.

380
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,509
It was?
Yeah, it was.
