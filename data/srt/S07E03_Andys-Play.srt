1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,762
Andy?

2
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:10,363
<i>Attend the tale</i>
<i>Of Sweeney Todd</i>

3
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:14,610
<i>His skin was pale</i>
<i>And his eye was odd</i>

4
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:15,702
Yes.

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,371
<i>He shaved the faces</i>
<i>Of gentlemen</i>

6
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:19,711
<i>Who never thereafter</i>
<i>Were heard of again</i>

7
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:22,616
<i>He trod a path</i>
<i>That few have trod</i>

8
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:24,950
<i>Did Sweeney Todd</i>

9
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,219
<i>The demon barber</i>
<i>Of Fleet Street</i>

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,020
Did you write this?
No.

11
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:32,322
Who did?
Stephen Sondheim.

12
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:33,556
Who is he?

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,396
<i>Swing your</i>
<i>Razor wide, Sweeney</i>

14
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:41,164
<i>Hold it to the skies</i>

15
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:47,404
<i>Freely flows the blood</i>
<i>Of those who moralize</i>

16
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:49,342
What the hell is happening?

17
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:50,710
We are the cast
of <i>Sweeney Todd:</i>

18
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,043
<i>The Demon Barber</i>
<i>of Fleet Street.</i>

19
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:53,309
We open in
a couple of weeks

20
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:54,941
at the Loose Screw
Playhouse, here in Scranton.

21
00:00:55,018 --> 00:00:59,580
And today, just doing
a wee bit
of viral marketing, gov'nor!

22
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:01,681
ALL:
<i>Attend the tale</i>
<i>Of Sweeney Todd</i>

23
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:05,552
<i>He served a dark</i>
<i>and a vengeful God</i>

24
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,563
<i>He served a dark</i>
<i>and a vengeful God</i>

25
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,358
<i>What happens then</i>
<i>Well, that's the play</i>

26
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>And he wouldn't</i>
<i>Want us to give it away</i>

27
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:16,572
<i>Not Sweeney Todd</i>

28
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,775
<i>The demon barber of Fleet</i>

29
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:22,304
<i>Street</i>

30
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,875
Wow!

31
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:31,149
Oh, that was amazing!
That was awesome!

32
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:33,951
I auditioned for this!
When did the cast list go up?

33
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:36,017
Like a month ago.

34
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:37,685
Really? They didn't call me!

35
00:01:40,364 --> 00:01:41,422
Who am I playing?

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,726
Andy?

37
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:24,804
Two comps for milady
and her Gabe.
It's closing night.

38
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,274
Tomorrow we have to
give the theater over

39
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,809
to the Scranton's
Miss Fitness Pageant.

40
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:31,541
I am so excited,
but I just need one.
Gabe can't come. Sorry.

41
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:33,412
What?
Yeah.

42
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,917
That's awful.
Everyone's
gonna miss that guy.

43
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:38,750
Gabe is not coming,
which is huge,

44
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:41,086
because my plan
is to make Erin

45
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:42,954
fall back in love
with me tonight.

46
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:47,122
Women cannot resist
a man singing show tunes.

47
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:49,966
It's so powerful,
even a lot of men

48
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,467
can't resist a man
singing show tunes.

49
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:54,265
Oh, who else is going?
Everyone.

50
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:55,498
Gabe seemed to
think no one was going.

51
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:59,003
What kind of terrible
rumormonger is Gabe?

52
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:01,544
He is woefully
ill informed, all right?

53
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,771
Excuse me.

54
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:07,406
Everybody, you're all coming
to my show tonight, right?

55
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:08,473
Andy, what time's it start?

56
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:09,541
8:00 p.m. Sharp.

57
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:11,086
How long is it?
Hour and 45...

58
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:12,280
No, I can't make it.

59
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:15,957
They say that no one
can take your pride,

60
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:19,655
but the people who
cast Andy's play,
they took mine.

61
00:03:20,263 --> 00:03:21,958
Jim, Pam, you guys
are in, right?

62
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:25,934
Oh, we wanted to, but our
sitter just fell through.
I'm really sorry.

63
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:27,927
Dwight?
No, thank you.

64
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,105
Last time I went
to the theater,

65
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,006
a man dressed as
a cat sat on my lap.

66
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:39,512
It would mean so much
to me if you came to
my show tonight.

67
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,915
I can't, Andy.
It's too hard.

68
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:43,247
That's...

69
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:47,246
I put everything I
had into that audition.
Do you understand that?

70
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:48,450
If it makes you
feel any better,

71
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:52,017
no one who auditioned
for the part of Sweeney Todd
got that part.

72
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,187
They had to bring
in a ringer.

73
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,591
This guy's, like, world class.
You should not feel bad.

74
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,729
I'm asking you,
thespian to thespian,

75
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:05,571
will you please
be the bigger man
and come to my show?

76
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:08,577
I wish I could,
Andy, but I can't.

77
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:11,136
I have plans that night.

78
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:14,672
I'm going to see
a friend in a play
called <i>Sweeney Todd.</i>

79
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:19,478
You're that friend.
I'm going to see your play.

80
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:23,019
Nice!

81
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:25,027
And scene.

82
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:28,128
Listen, I would like
you to take me to
Andy's play tonight.

83
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:30,327
Please, waste of time.

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,561
You know what?
Let's just knock
this out right now.

85
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:33,762
Disrobe.

86
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:38,240
Angela?
Don't like her anymore.
Not attracted to her anymore.

87
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:41,209
Just contractually obligated
to make a baby with her.

88
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,478
Give me the punch card.
No.

89
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:44,707
If you want to
punch the punch card,

90
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:45,873
you have to take
me to the show.

91
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,880
That is not in the contract.

92
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:50,283
Well, there's a lot of
gray area in that clause.

93
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:51,752
Do you want to re-mediate?

94
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:55,053
All right, fine!
I'll go to your little show.

95
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,183
But I'm not wearing a cape.

96
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:57,248
Thank you.

97
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:59,727
Dwight and I have
a contractual agreement

98
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:02,629
to procreate five times,
plain and simple.

99
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,726
And should he
develop feelings for me?

100
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, that would be
permissible under
item 7C, clause 2,

101
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:13,440
so I would not object.

102
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,603
Hey. How are those salads?

103
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,703
It's my own fault...

104
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,409
My parents used
to scramble to
find babysitters

105
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:22,418
so they could take
my little brother
to do stuff.

106
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:23,646
I understand how
hard it can be.

107
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,352
I just... Tonight,
I mean, if you could...

108
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:27,583
We'll keep looking.

109
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:28,783
Yes!
Really?

110
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:31,521
I mean, who knows?
Maybe I have a niece
my family never told me about.

111
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:33,222
Oh, my gosh,
that would be amazing.

112
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,661
Yeah.
For a lot of reasons.

113
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:37,529
Yeah, I know. Niece!

114
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:40,428
Oh! Hey, guys.

115
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:42,165
You brought
balloons to a play?

116
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,639
I did, because I am
being the bigger man,

117
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,335
and balloons are
bigger than flowers.

118
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,398
It's nice, like <i>Up.</i>

119
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:48,466
Yes.

120
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:51,445
Excuse me.
Are you the guy
that did an entire

121
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,881
<i>Law & Order</i> episode
for his audition?

122
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,411
Nope.

123
00:05:58,622 --> 00:06:00,590
Guys?
ALL: Hey!

124
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:01,919
Andy!
Hey!

125
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:04,222
You all made it.
Thank you so much.

126
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:05,761
You should
actually thank Erin.

127
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,353
She's the one who
agreed to babysit.

128
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:10,293
She's babysitting?

129
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:14,861
I really wanted to see
Andy's play, because
he's so, so talented,

130
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:17,702
but I've been trying
to get in the babysitting
game forever.

131
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:21,232
The 13- year-olds
in this town have
a complete monopoly.

132
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:23,836
It's almost like
a babysitters' club.

133
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,381
I understand.

134
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:29,816
This is, like, a huge
opportunity for her.

135
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,589
This is ridiculous.

136
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:42,356
You'd think they'd
discourage people
from bringing in balloons.

137
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:45,458
Hey, I think this guy
playing Sweeney Todd
is my plumber.

138
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:49,471
No, Darryl. This guy's
a world-class actor.

139
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,370
He doesn't daylight
as your plumber.

140
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:53,875
No, it's my plumber.
Says so in his bio.

141
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:56,344


142
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:58,779
It's his first play.
He didn't even audition.

143
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,577
Are you kidding me?
Shh.

144
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,912
If we don't
listen to the overture,

145
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,213
we won't recognize
the musical themes

146
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:04,378
when they come back later.

147
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:05,921
All right, I'm sorry.

148
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,989
God.

149
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:11,050

Oh!
There's gum on the seat,
and now it's on my work skirt.

172
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,702
I have to go change.

173
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:34,300
Too bad I'm not gonna
explain anything
that you miss.

174
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:36,174
Oh, Dwight, just move.

175
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:41,342
<i>Do they think that</i>
<i>walls can hide you?</i>

176
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:45,515
His name's Andy.
He's a terrible salesman.

177
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:49,115
I <i>am in the dark beside you</i>

178
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,925


179
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:01,765
Michael!

180
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:03,799
Shelby Thomas Weems,
the director.

181
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:04,999
Hello.

182
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:08,101
I promise you that if
you keep auditioning

183
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:09,839
with a similar gusto...
Okay.

184
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:13,747
...we are going to
find a production
with a role for Michael Scott.

185
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:14,943
Okay.
Yes?

186
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,042
Yes.
Good.

187
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,381
Good.
Enjoy the second act.

188
00:09:17,454 --> 00:09:18,716
You enjoy the second act.
Have a refreshment.

189
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:20,119
Thank you. You, too.

190
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:22,320
Thank you, thank you.

191
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:26,320
Come on, Dwight.

192
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:28,764
Why are you dressed
like a seed catalog model?

193
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:32,593
These are just my dirty
old gardening clothes.

194
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,330
They were all
that I had in my car.

195
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:35,666
Let's go.

196
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:42,544
Hey, Erin, it's Pam.
Hey, how you doing...

197
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:44,842
No, no, don't put Cece
on the phone, because
she can't talk yet.

198
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:49,473
Okay. No, I was
just calling to see
how everything's going.

199
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,349
Yeah? Yeah? It's good?

200
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,790
The play?
The play is kind of great.

201
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:59,123
I mean,
it's fun to hear Andy sing
in the appropriate setting.

202
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:02,358
No, he's really sorry
you couldn't make it, too.

203
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:06,300
Yeah.
So thank you so much again.
We're having a great time.

204
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:09,031
Oh, they're
flashing the lights,
so we should go in.

205
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:10,504
Thanks. Bye.

206
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:12,871
Okay, so we called,
and everything's fine.

207
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:14,170
Everything's fine.

208
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:15,268
We can relax.

209
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:16,903
We can relax.
Let's get our Sweeney on.

210
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,472
<i>Then</i> I <i>go</i>
<i>Walking with you-hoo</i>

211

00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:25,485
I <i>warm me bones</i>
<i>On the esplanade</i>

213

214
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:29,615

00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:32,354
I'll <i>knit a sweater</i>

<i>Don't you love the weather</i>

225
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:00,614
Just checking my e-mails.

226
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,182
See if I got any
last-minute "break-a-legs"

227
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,490
or "l-still-Iove-you"
type texts.

228
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:13,360
Doesn't look
like I got anything.
Maybe on my Facebook wall.

229
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,900
Unfortunately, in this
ham-fisted production
of <i>Sweeney Todd,</i>

230
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:24,674
the real terror
comes from the
vocal performances.

231
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:25,941
New paragraph.

232
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,813
Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd!
I found her!

233
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,882
You found Johanna.

234
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:34,549

a judge has locked her...

üMUSICAL TONE

238
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,866
There's a little
bird fluttering around.
Do hope it ceases chirping.

239
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:53,503
How is that funny?

240
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:57,603
The bird continues to call.
Someone please
turn off your bird.

241

242
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:02,714
Oh, for the love...
Turn your phone off!
There are signs!

243
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:03,877
Oh!

244
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:08,619
It appears the bird
was in mine own pocket
this whole time.

245
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:11,285
He's gone to sleep now.
I closed his beak.

246
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,525
What is the news
of my darling
daughter Johanna?

You know what?
Let me just double check.

249
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:22,667
Make sure that bird...

250
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:26,641
Okay, good. It's off.

251
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,039
I mean, silenced.
I silenced it by killing it.

252
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:34,914
I've killed it!
I'm a murderer!
Just like you, Sweeney Todd!

253
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,451
See? It all connects.

254
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,247
Not that I know
you're a murderer.

255
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:41,847
My character
doesn't know that yet.

256
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,823
But I'm suspicious,
because of all the razors
that you have laying around.

257
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:50,559


258
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:53,497
but you're a barber,
so that's legit.

259
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,003
So there's that.

260
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:57,198
But...

261
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:58,604


262
00:12:58,675 --> 00:12:59,801
A madhouse.
A madhouse?

263
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:01,867
Yes, a madhouse.

264
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:03,344
A madhouse?

265
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:05,142
Johanna is as good
as rescued.

266
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:06,909
Where do you suppose
all the wig makers

267
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,781
of London go to
obtain their human hair?

268
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,376
Do you think...

269
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:14,279
So you think...

270
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:26,265
So you think...
Fogg's Asylum, why not?

271
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,505
Sounds like Cece.

272
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,908
Okay, I think everybody
just needs to relax.

273
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:36,968
Oh, my God. Go, go.

274
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,138
Oh, my God.

275
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:49,520
That's really
irresponsible of Erin.
She's a terrible babysitter.

276
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:54,996
I just didn't think
you guys were
gonna see us.

277
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:56,998
We were just gonna
stop by and then
get some ice cream

278
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,090
and then go home.

279
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:00,200
Okay, this was
pretty simple. Right?

280
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,293
Why are you here?

281
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:03,202
All you had to do
was play with her

282
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,069
for, like, 30 minutes
and then put her to bed.

283
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:07,075
Then we were kind of
hoping that you wouldn't
touch her again.

284
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,940
Babies shouldn't have
ice cream, by the way.

285
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:12,471
I'm sorry. I just...
I really wanted to see Andy.

286
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:13,947
You guys made it
sound so un-missable,

287
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:16,110
and you set me
up with a car seat
and everything.

288
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:18,710
Well, the car seat
was to take her
to the hospital or...

289
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,085
But why would I take
her to the hospital?

290
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:24,159
You know what,
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

291
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:26,855
Why don't I
just take her home,
and let you guys finish,

292
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:28,794
and then you should
stay out as late
as you want.

293
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:30,730
No, we're good.
Thank you, though.

294
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,926
Yeah.
Thanks.

295
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,060
Okay. All right, bye, Cece.

296
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,498
Okay.
All right.

297
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,298
Well, we're never
leaving the house again.

298
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:39,398
Not together.

299
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,363
That was more
horrifying than <i>Nunsense.</i>

300
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:10,599
All that singing
got in the way

301
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:12,834
of some perfectly
good murders.

302
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,641
Where's my car?

303
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:25,945
Come on.

304
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,924
Mmm!
Fruit is so much
better when it's dried.

305
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:32,688
I've already eaten,
like, 30 apricots.

306
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:33,786
Darryl?

307
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:34,852
Hey!

308
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:36,330
Didn't know you
were gonna be here.

309
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,991
How's the toilet?
Silent.

310
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,762
Look, congratulations.
Thank you.

311
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:43,363
I had no idea.
This plumber has pipes.

312
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,600
Yeah, good job. Well done.

313
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,301
You're the guy
who booed me.

314
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,004
Mmm-mmm.

315
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,407
No, there were a lot
of people booing you.
I wasn't one of them.

316
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:55,076
No, I saw you,
and you were the only one.

317
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,085
Get your eyes checked,
chucklehead.

318
00:15:57,153 --> 00:16:00,418
Be cool, Michael.
I saw this guy kill
a bunch of people.

319
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,355
Good work.
Thank you.

320
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:06,886
You didn't have to boo him.

321
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:08,863
He was getting
a lot of applause,

322
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:10,558
and I just didn't
think it was indicative

323
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:11,964
of how people
were really feeling.

324
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:13,331
How would you like
it if we booed you?

325
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:15,302
That would never happen.

326
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:16,598
Okay.

327
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,266
I appreciate the feedback.

328
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,469
I don't like that at all.

329
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,738
Are you ready?

330
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:27,942
Yes.

331
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:30,713
I'm so scared!
Okay, kill me!
Just kill me! Kill me!

332
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:35,590
Blood everywhere.
Oh, no.

333
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,885
I'm so glad we're hanging
out again outside of work.

334
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:40,223
Yeah, me, too.

335
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:42,786
Okay, I kill you now.

336
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:43,854
Okay.

337
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,392
All right.

338
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:47,928
All right, let's do this.

339
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:50,905
You know, actually, Dwight,
I didn't realize how far
this walk was,

340
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:52,235
and I'm exhausted.

341
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:53,502
It's okay, I smell.

342
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,908
No. No, no, no. I think
I just want to go home,

343
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:58,572
but it's okay.
This can count as
one of your times.

344
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:00,912
No, no, no.
Contractually, we're
obligated to have sex.

345
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:02,643
Well, I won't
tell if you don't.

346
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:04,549
I will tell.
I will tell the mediator.

347
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,050
What...
What are you... Oh, okay.

348
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,351
Oh, was that in the way?
Get rid of it. Oh!

349
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:16,226
Good night, Dwight.

350
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,203
Good night.

351
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:30,442
These would have
been your seats.
Best seats in the house.

352
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:33,676
Lot of people think it
would be the front row,
but, actually, right here,

353
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,274
this is where
the speakers converge

354
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:39,150
and the sound just,
like, nails you right here.

355
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:40,814
This is awesome.

356
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,118
Oh.

357
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:43,351
Sorry. Oh.
Oh.

358
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:44,817
Hi, Gabe.

359
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:49,859
Yeah, I just stopped
by Andy's cast party
to say hi to everyone.

360
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:53,163
Sure, I can pick you up
some soup. What do you want?

361
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:54,965
That's broth, Gabe.

362
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:57,732
Okay, I'll see you soup.

363
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:01,075
Okay, I have to go.
Thank you so much.

364
00:18:01,143 --> 00:18:03,907
This was so much fun,
and I'm really sorry
that I missed your play,

365
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,039
but next time,
I'll be there.

366
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:08,083
Or here.
Right here, I promise.

367
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,640
Awesome.
Okay.

368
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,277
See you later.

369
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:12,685
Thank you.

370
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:23,461


371
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:24,829
This night was a disaster.

372
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,061
No, it was not a disaster.

373
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:29,161
It was weird,
but it wasn't a disaster.

374
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:33,507
I think we have, like,
a gift bottle of Irish Cream.

375
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,339
Yeah?
We could put that
in orange juice.

376
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:36,537
Get it.
Yeah?

377
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,546
Let's get our juice on.
Yeah.

378
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,282
PHYLLIS: Found him.

379
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:47,314
Hey, what's going on here?
Post-show blues?

380
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,857
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

381
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:50,949
Yeah, I get those
every day after work.

382
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:52,460
Your show was
really great, Andy.

383
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:55,656
Interesting subject matter.
I'm surprised
you pulled it off.

384
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,963
It was like amateur hour.

385
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,626
It was an amateur production,
technically.

386
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:03,866
Oscar,
enough with the sass, please!
God! What is wrong with you?

387
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,531
Andy, listen to me.

388
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:06,973
Look me in the eye.

389
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,841
I thought that
you were awesome.

390
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:09,969
Stop just saying that.

391
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,445
I am not just saying that.

392
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,505
You can trust that I am
telling you the truth.

393
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:16,574
I booed someone tonight.
I have no filter.

394
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:19,018
And if I thought
you were terrible,
I would have booed.

395
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,851
And if I thought you
had done a better job,

396
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:23,619
I would be saying
nicer things right now.

397
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:26,594
But I thought that you
were exactly awesome.

398
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,425
No better, no worse.

399
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,493
Thank you.
That feels good.

400
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:36,027
I did not say that
to make you feel good.
I just said it.

401
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:37,697
Total integrity.

402
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:39,400
DARRYL: Andy,
sing us another song.

403
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,238
Thanks, but I feel
like a Ioner right now.

404
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,675
Come on, Andy.
You were the highlight.

405
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:44,042
Come on, Andy, seriously.

406
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:45,273

In the criminal
justice system,

424
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:52,537
the people are represented
by two separate
yet equally important groups,

425
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:54,048
the police who
investigate the crimes,

426
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,812
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

427
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:58,183
These are their stories.

428
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:04,223


429
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,260
A dead body!

430
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,994


431
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:12,227
It looks like a classic case
of autoerotic asphyxiation.

432
00:21:12,301 --> 00:21:15,600
Yeah, looks like everybody's
tightening their
belts in this economy.

Last time I saw
