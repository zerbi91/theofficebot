1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,030
They caught
the Scranton Strangler.

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,097
They trapped him
in his house.

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,570
FEMALE NEWSCASTER ON COMPUTER:
<i>...and then</i>
<i>photographing them,</i>

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,907
<i>is believed to be inside.</i>

5
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,746
<i>Police have now surrounded</i>
<i>the apartment complex.</i>

6
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,078
Police have surrounded.
<i>And we</i>

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,812
<i>now see what appears to</i>
<i>be a SWAT van pulling up.</i>

8
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,378
SWAT, SWAT's arriving.

9
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,185
<i>It is unknown if he</i>
<i>is armed with any...</i>

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,020
They should
do that thing
where they play

11
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,459
the really good music
to get him to come out.

12
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:31,425
Ugh! They shouldn't
televise any of this.
It just encourages copycats.

13
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,700
Just say copies.
Why do you have to
drag cats into this?

14
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,396
Okay, while this is
interesting, we should
get back to work.

15
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,197
These standoffs
can last a long time.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,065
What if it's
another Waco?

17
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,404
It's pronounced "wacko."

18
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,172
Some events
are so newsworthy,

19
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,941
so historic,
that you have to stop
everything to watch.

20
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,879
Balloon boy,
Michael Jackson's funeral...

21
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,782
Uh, things that,
if you didn't
see them live,

22
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,618
you wouldn't really
care that you didn't
see them at all.

23
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,688
FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
<i>Coming to you</i>
<i>from the corner of...</i>

24
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,589
Columbia Street
and Washington Ave.

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,228
God, when is he
gonna come out?

26
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,764
<i>For what we all</i>
<i>pray is the last...</i>

27
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,392
ANDY: I bet he's wishing
he had a hybrid, right?

28
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,991
Sixty miles
to the gallon
in the city!

29
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,133
No, I bet he's wishing
he was strangling someone.

30
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,365
Okay, that's our street.

31
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,273
That's our street.
He's going down
our street.

32
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,400
Come on, everybody.

33
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,871
KEVIN: Go. Go, go, go.

34
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,570
There it is.
There it is.

35
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:21,807
I saw it.
ANDY: Where? Where?

36
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,373
I saw it. It's gone.

37
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,440
ANDY: Oh!

38
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,578
He went right by.

39
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,849
You missed it.
You missed it.

40
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,189
MICHAEL: <i>"Grandpa,</i>
<i>where were you the day</i>

41
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,161
<i>"the Scranton Strangler</i>
<i>was caught?"</i>

42
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,665


43
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:44,193
And I'll tell you what,

44
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:50,003
you go sell these
and buy yourself
a nice spaceship.

45
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,027
Michael.

46
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,135
Walk with me.

47
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,565
Gabe and I are
having a party,

48
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,538
and everyone's invited,
and it's at his apartment.

49
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,198
And we're gonna watch <i>Glee.</i>
<i>Glee?</i> What is <i>Glee?</i>

50
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,707
Some sort of
television program?

51
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,801
Jim, I need
that thing, stat.

52
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,368
Okay.
ERIN: Yeah,
it's a TV show.

53
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,846
Dwight. Signing.

54
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,110
I don't have time for
parties. I don't have
time for TV shows.

55
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,947
Stanley,
what time is that thing
that I have to do?

56
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,079
I...
Cancel it.
Are you still here?

57
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,580
Oh, it's just...
It's our first
party together.

58
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,818
So...
Mmm-mmm!

59
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:40,883
Did you hear
what I said?

60
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,926
I'm a very busy man.
I don't have time
for your TV show.

61
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,398
Okay, sorry.
I'm joking.

62
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,892
Wait, which...
I'm joking.

63
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,065
I'm kidding around.

64
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,038
I'm not actually angry.

65
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,238
I'm not busy at all.
I'm not doing anything.

66
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,301
And I know what <i>Glee</i> is.
I am a total Gleek.

67
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,479
Oh, me too.
You know who my
favorite character is?

68
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,138
The invalid.

69
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:03,910
Yes, I'd love to
come to your party.

70
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,441
Oh, my gosh.

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,886
I don't know
if Michael likes
Gabe that much,

72
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,855
but there's
this thing on <i>Glee</i>
called mash-up,

73
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,519
where two things
that don't go together
make one great song.

74
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,325
Take Gabe, take Michael,
you make "Gaymike."

75
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,122
Best friends.

76
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,425
No, really?

77
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,693
Is there time
to change this?
That show...

78
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,900
I mean,
first they say
that Mr. Schue

79
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,564
doesn't know
anything about
choreography,

80
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,236
and then, like,
three episodes later,

81
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,209
he's this fantastic
choreographer.

82
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,267
Pick a lane, people.

83
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,103
And what was with
Jesse's sudden turn

84
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,876
on Rachel between
<i>Dream On</i> and <i>Funk?</i>

85
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,576
Where the heck
did that come from?

86
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,586
Honestly,
that show, it's just...
It's irresponsible.

87
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,413
Are you going?

88
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,621
Not because I want to.

89
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:48,425
Of all feelings,
to base a show
around glee?

90
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,791
Thirst. Now that's
a show I'd watch.

91
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,630
I would watch that.

92
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,793
Tonight might be
a convenient night

93
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:55,892
for us to have
some intercourse.

94
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,504
You're having a party
at Gabe's apartment?
Mmm-hmm.

95
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,339
I'd love it if
you were there.
You would?

96
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,272
You and Michael
are always the
life of the party.

97
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,114
Try and keep me
from coming.

98
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,913
Why would I keep
you from coming?

99
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,188
Try and hide it,
I will track
this party down.

100
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,848


101
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,516
Kevin.

102
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,152
Hey. You going tonight?

103
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,288
Yes, I am. Are you?

104
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,429
Yeah. You got to go
to the boss's party, right?

105
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,489
Mmm-hmm.

106
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,661
What? No, Gabe...
Gabe is not the boss.

107
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,470
No, he's not the boss.

108
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,506
Why did you just
say he was the boss?

109
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,403
'Cause you're the boss.

110
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,647
Guys, do you consider
Gabe to be the boss?

111
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,383
It's a make-your-own-pizza
night.

112
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,443
MICHAEL: Okay.

113
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,581
Isn't Gabe's
place so nice?
Uh-huh.

114
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,522
Look at the size
of those wine glasses,
Michael.

115
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,583
They're big.

116
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,662
Those posters used
to be real French ads.

117
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,789
All right.

118
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,662
So, these are your
cheeses, your hams,

119
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,999
your sausages,
your herbs and
your vegetables.

120
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,966
Here's what's been done.
Start creating.

121
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,764
Sometimes it helps
to think of a part
of the world

122
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,037
and then make...
Okay. Okay. Okay.

123
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,341
Gabe likes to
entertain a lot,

124
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:16,372
and he cooks in an oven,
and all that jazz.

125
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,009
I just have
a different lifestyle.

126
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,485
They have these
bags of vegetables

127
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,819
that steam right
inside their own bag.

128
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,649
So, I'll get a glass
of sangria,

129
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,317
sit down in front
of the TV,

130
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,225
my bag of vegetables...

131
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,927
Before you know it,
I'm ready for bed.

132
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,388
Okay.

133
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,632
You don't really
toss the dough.

134
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,360
Try to destroy
the old ways, Gabe.

135
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,166
I will not let you.

136
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,243
So, welcome
to my man cave.

137
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,671
I did my senior
year abroad in Japan.
Best year of my life.

138
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,805
You play?

139
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,441
I like to create
soundscapes.

140
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,922
Imagine one instant of
a song expanded to be
the size of the universe.

141
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,480
I can't even do that.

142
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,655
She's up. Great.

143
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,691
Cece is reverse cycling,

144
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,631
which means she
sleeps all day,
and she's up all night,

145
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,864
which basically means
I'm up all day,
and I'm up all night.

146
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:14,636
And if it doesn't stop soon,
I am gonna be up all night.

147
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,975
The show's starting.
The show's starting.

148
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,979
The show's starting.

149
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,542
Show's starting.

150
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,118
FINN: <i>All right,</i>
<i>let's gather around.</i>

151
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,046
Who's that?

152
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,114
KELLY: Finn.

153
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,153
Who's that?
Rachel.

154
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,429
Okay. Which one's Glee?

155
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,227
You have to stop.

156
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,858
Where's Michael?
Where's Michael?

157
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,266
We can't start
without Michael.

158
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:47,103
Oh, here he is.
Oh, yay, and let
the show begin.

159
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,933
GABE: That's a little loud.

160
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:54,409
Well, actually, I think
it's not loud enough. May I?

161
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,444
Excuse me.
Thank you, sir.

162
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,881
There you go.
It's <i>Glee,</i> right?

163
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,284
Rock and roll.

164
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,821
Turn it up to 11.

165
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,083
Come on, Michael.

166
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,125
Spinal cord.

167
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,724
Some of us are trying
to have a conversation.

168
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,793
Well, some of us
are trying to...

169
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,353
I'll just turn
the captions on.

170
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,962
Well, I will turn
the volume up.

171
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,860
That's for the other box.

172
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,870
Okay.

173
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,904
Okay.

174
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,779
Here's what
we're gonna do.

175
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,340
Right down the hall
is a bedroom.

176
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,853
All the real <i>Glee</i> fans
are gonna go down the hall

177
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,616
to the real <i>Glee</i>
party in the bedroom.

178
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,282
Follow me

179
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,223
where we can crank it.

180
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,191
What's your angle?
That woman.

181
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,926
She's been in
a couple of episodes
of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i>

182
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,023
You know what?
I'm so confused.

183
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,298
Is this a <i>Glee</i> watching
party or is this
a <i>Glee</i> pausing party?

184
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,305
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Because we keep stopping it

185
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,635
to get a history
lesson about
television...

186
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,697
OSCAR: I didn't
know the rules.

187
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,402
There. It's on, it's on.

188
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,477
I didn't read
the rule book.

189
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,704
Hey, Michael.

190
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,708
Maybe you should try going
in the other room again.

191
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,979
You can have my seat.
It's closer to the TV.

192
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,044
It'll seem louder.

193
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,149
Pam, I have a loaded gun
in my desk at work.

194
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,622
And if I ever start
acting like that
weenie, Gabe,

195
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,856
I want you to
take that gun,

196
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,728
and I want you
to shoot me,
like, 100 times

197
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,699
in the groin
till I'm dead, okay?

198
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,334
You have a gun
in your desk?

199
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:23,995
Somewhere.

200
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,836
Hey. Marantz tube
stereo from the 1970s!

201
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,634
I respect that.
I respect that a lot.

202
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,141
The five Chinese
virility herbs.

203
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,411
No kidding.
This is powdered
seahorse.

204
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,016
They say that 15
Chinese soldiers

205
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,783
fought off the entire
army of Genghis Khan
just using this stuff.

206
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,348
You know what they say...
No, what?

207
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,028
What is this,
samurai woodcuts? Yup.

208
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:50,919
Pretty erotic.

209
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,488
Hmm. Yeah.

210
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,968
Better men than Gabe
have tried to be my boss.

211
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,298
David got fired.

212
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,567
Charles got fired.
Jan went crazy.

213
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,674
Ed Truck,
who I liked,
got decapitated.

214
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,733
Michael.
Yes.

215
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,280
I find it
absolutely disgraceful

216
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,213
that no one
followed you in here
for your walk-out.

217
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,477
I took the liberty of
making a list of everyone
who didn't follow you in here.

218
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,611
Jim, Oscar, Creed,

219
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,881
me, at first... Kelly...
Maybe I should go.

220
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,052
Are you gonna
quiet that baby
or do I have to?

221
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,937
In the Schrute family,
the youngest child
always raises the others.

222
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,068
I've been raising
children since
I was a baby.

223
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,010
Take a shot.

224
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,048
Oh, thanks.

225
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,489
So much Asian stuff!

226
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,754
I wonder if there's
a guy in China right now

227
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,125
looking at
a bunch of our stuff.

228
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,162
Why does Erin
like Gabe?

229
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,401
Andy, look,

230
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,529
all I know is,
if I was a girl
and I had to choose

231
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,438
between a tall
dude who loved Asia

232
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:12,178
and a you-looking dude
who loved sweaters
and wearing sweaters,

233
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,141
I'd choose you.

234
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,114
That's really nice.
Thank you.

235
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,052
And I'd blow your mind.

236
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,094
OSCAR: Jim, what
are you doing?

237
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,329
It's a commercial break,
so I just wanted
to check the scores.

238
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,392
Flip it back, please.

239
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,665
Okay.

240
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,366
The show's back on.
What happened?

241
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:44,937
We were behind.

242
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,305
Go to the recorded version.

243
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,004
Oh, my God.
What song was that?

244
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,640
I wasn't recording it.
What?

245
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,617
What song was it?

246
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,811
Wait, why do you
have to record it?

247
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,188
Right now is why, Erin.
We're living it.

248
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,647
Start recording now.
Jim.

249
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,389
Okay, they did
<i>Blinded by the Light,</i>

250
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,258
and they did it with
an actual blind guy.

251
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:06,055
Was it worth it, Jim?
'Cause we missed it.

252
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,865
If I could get her
sleeping normally,
I would get my life back.

253
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,628
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?

254
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,067
I can't even
talk about it.

255
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,674
You know, it's not
really necessary for me

256
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,233
to sit here
holding her all night.

257
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,710
Just go to
Gabe's refrigerator,
get a lump of suet,

258
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,773
or any kind of
congealed animal
fat will do, really.

259
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,479
Tie a piece of string to it,
tie the other end to her toe,

260
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,317
pop the suet
in her mouth,

261
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,185
she'll be happy for hours.

262
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,023
I kind of doubt
Gabe has suet.

263
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,519
Really?

264
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,292
Well, then here we are.

265
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,388
Michael.

266
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,631
Gabe is making
the pigs in a blanket,

267
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,603


268
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,765
so he was wondering
if you could help him.

269
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Phyllis Vance.

270
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,186
Is that White Diamonds
by Elizabeth Taylor?

271
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,487
You know your perfumes.

272
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,656
My nanny used
to wear that.

273
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,194
I just ate an
entire seahorse.

274
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,858
<i>I have to admit,</i>
<i>I did not think</i>
<i>it was gonna work,</i>

275
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,196
<i>but it's totally working.</i>

276
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,135
<i>I feel exactly</i>
<i>like a seahorse.</i>

277
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,235
Look who I found.

278
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,508
Yeah, well, I wasn't
very hard to find.

279
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,977
Let's go ahead
and wash your hands.

280
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,046
Is this the same dough
that you used for
the pizza crust?

281
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,155
Yeah. Waste not, right?

282
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,350
So, these are pizza dogs.
These aren't
pigs in a blanket,

283
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,683
per se.

284
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,596
Michael knows
everything there is
to know about snacks.

285
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,654
Well.

286
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,291
Gabe was born in 1982.

287
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,092
He was the longest
baby in the hospital.

288
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,568
He's the longest
baby in this room.

289
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,864
What's the longest thing
you've ever seen?

290
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,964
For me,
it was the tail
from a jet...

291
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,064
Erin, you don't have to...

292
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,837
Yeah, you know what,
Erin, you do have to.
Michael,

293
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,641
you are making this
harder than it has to be.

294
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,008
That's what she said.

295
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,747
Hey.

296
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,119
PAM: It's a miracle.

297
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,627
She loves him.

298
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,330
I don't know
about "love."

299
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,157
She loves me.

300
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,665
Outside. My car.
Two minutes.

301
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,673
All right. Something's
come up. I gotta go.

302
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,731
No, no, no,
she'll wake up.

303
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:30,866
No, I have
something to do.

304
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,946
I know what you have to do.
Please stay with Cece.

305
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:38,446
Dwight,
I've always considered us
to be very good friends.

306
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,816
Great friends.

307
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,013
Remember your concussion?

308
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,020
I do,

309
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,250
but you married
my worst enemy.

310
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,293
I know.
Well, I think
enemy's a strong word,

311
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,224
'cause I think we have
a really charming
back-and-forth...

312
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,626
Enough.

313
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,796
I will require
beer and pizza
to think this over.

314
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,595
Absolutely.
From Jim.

315
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,661
Well, I don't
think that's...

316
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,106
Do it.

317
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,837
What kind of pizza
would you like?

318
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,878
Surprise me. No.

319
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,238
Pepperoni.

320
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,645
Okay.

321
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,452
All right.

322
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,254
And the winner is,
by two votes, Sam and...

323
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,362


324
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,233
Hey, Creed.
Do you read Chinese?

325
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,461
Better than English.

326
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,530
What does this say?

327
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:48,543
Hello, UPS, still waiting
on that five minutes
with Erin I ordered.

328
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,021
Oh, never mind,
it's here.

329
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,226
Well, if it isn't
the belle of the ball.

330
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,653
You throw
a lovely party, milady.

331
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,258
Are you having
a good time?

332
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,164
Did you wear
my favorite outfit
on purpose?

333
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,224
Andy, you look awful.

334
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,932
You're four seasons
in a day.

335
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,702
You got the autumn
thing going on.

336
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,643
But if you put on baby...

337
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,273
But if you put
on a blue...

338
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,620
It's springtime
in the Rockies.

339
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,819
Are you all right?
No!

340
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,828
Mmm-mmm.
Insert it in my mouth.

341
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,023
Okay, that's not
gonna make your

342
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,793
pizza-eating experience
any better, trust me.

343
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,855
Oh, try me.

344
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,926
Jim, just don't
think of it as
degrading.

345
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,632
Think of it as you happen
to be moving the pizza

346
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,669
six inches this way,
and he happens
to be biting it.

347
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,711
I'd prefer for him to
think of it as degrading.

348
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,767
Okay.

349
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,745
Crust first.

350
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,679
Okay. Now the beer.

351
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,347
Beer me, Jim.

352
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,663
Gentle.

353
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,325
Mmm, mmm.

354
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,731
Now I've got to
go meet Angela.

355
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,670
What? No, wait.
You said you
were gonna help us.

356
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,866
I have a legal
obligation to Angela,
okay?

357
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,172
She needs to be serviced.

358
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,405
You need to stop talking.
Oh, God.

359
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,811
Oh, come on.

360
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,348
Can we stop
the fake prissy act?

361
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,405
Join the real world.

362
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,042
Sex contracts exist, okay?

363
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,813
Okay, fine, there
must be some way

364
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,411
to get out of it,
even just for tonight.

365
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,013
Yeah, sure.
Jim can go see her.

366
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,047
Okay.
You've been with
a blonde before?

367
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,148
It's the big leagues.

368
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,487
I'm going home,
and I'm taking my baby.

369
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,392
No, no, don't.

370
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,555
I will go
talk to Angela.

371
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,228
She is in heat.

372
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,357
She will eat
your face off.

373
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,467
The reverse cycling
ends tonight.

374
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,068
A single piece of
pepperoni, please.

375
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,808
I'm not...

376
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:58,810
What are you doing?

377
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:03,255
I wanted to eat
a pig in a blanket
in a blanket.

378
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,925
PHYLLIS: Are you all right?

379
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,402
Erin likes Gabe.

380
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,765
I know.

381
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,669
I thought you two
were nice together.

382
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,605
Do you think
that they've ever...

383
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,664
Made love?

384
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,041
I don't know.

385
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,710
Well, girls tell each
other things, right?

386
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,117
I'll see what
I can find out.

387
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,211
Where you been?

388
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,913
I just went out
for a walk.

389
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,522
Cable's out.

390
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,288
What? Really?

391
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,554
That stinks.

392
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,789
It's still on upstairs.

393
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,966
What does that mean?
Party's over?
Everybody leaves?

394
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,156
CREED: Are you sure?

395
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:52,669
Hey,
Puck and Finn worked it out,
and the solo is now a duet.

396
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,172
Are you kidding me?
No.

397
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,299
Now, that's going on.
Yep.

398
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,170
KEVIN: I can't believe
we're missing that.

399
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,713
Boy, I wish
I could see that.

400
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,081
You know what?
I have an idea.

401
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,543
I don't know if
it's gonna work,

402
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,950
but let me give
it this... Okay.

403
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,009
I'm gonna
give it a shot.

404
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,386
Please, Michael,
just make the <i>Glee</i> happen.

405
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,480
Good luck, Michael.

406
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,855
Erin.

407
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,793
So, how long have you
two been going out now?

408
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,420
Oh, like three months.

409
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,464
I imagine things are
starting to heat up.

410
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:20,855
I don't know.

411
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,458
Of course, you don't
want to rush things.

412
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,528
I mean, the anticipation
can be so exquisite.

413
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,806
Bob and I
took our time.

414
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,433
The first time we
saw each other naked,
we didn't even make love.

415
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,173
We just stared at each other
until we fell asleep.

416
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,373
It was magical.

417
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,079
I have to go, Phyllis.
Really magical.

418
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,219
Hey in there.
It's me, Pam.

419
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,586
It's not Dwight.
Don't think it's Dwight.

420
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,549
What are you doing here?

421
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,151
I know you and Dwight
have this weird deal.

422
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,157
He sent me out here
to see if you
could postpone.

423
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,262
Are you authorized
to do this?

424
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,460
Yes. I have been
so authorized.

425
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,668
Okay, well, tell him
that we'll do this
tomorrow night instead.

426
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,730
Okay.
Wait, Pam. Pam.

427
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,703
How did he seem?
You know, like, did
he seem disappointed?

428
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,814
You know, there are
a lot of guys out there

429
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,247
who would just love

430
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,478
and appreciate a woman...
You know what,
Pam, just save it.

431
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,348
You did this?

432
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,893
No, I was just check...
Yes, I did. Yes. Yes.

433
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:22,951
Why won't you like him?

434
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,998
What is there to like?
He's just...

435
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:30,496
He's a weird, little,
skeevy guy with no waist.

436
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,231
Why do you care
whether we like
him or not?

437
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,034
I care if you like him.

438
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,966
Why? I'm not
your father.

439
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,115
All right.

440
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,386
Okay.
Go to your room.

441
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,050
What?

442
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,857
Go to your room,
young lady.

443
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,802
I'm not going
to my room.

444
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,996
You listen to me.

445
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,166
You listen good.

446
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:12,268
You are not to see
that boy anymore.

447
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,571
You listen to me.

448
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,638
You are not to
tell me what to do.

449
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,650
As long as you are
living under this roof,

450
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,912
you are going
to do what I say.

451
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,247
I hate your roof.

452
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,378
Do not raise
your voice to me.

453
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,319
I'll raise it all I want.
I'll raise the roof.

454
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,187
I will pull
this car over.

455
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,283
I hate it.
I hate your car.

456
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,590
See you, Oscar.

457
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,561
If you break that girl's
heart, I will kill you.

458
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:37,926
It's just a figure
of speech.

459
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,903
But seriously, if you
break that girl's heart,

460
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,738
I will literally kill you
and your entire family.

461
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,176
<i>Gabe, just go</i>
<i>and have fun with Erin,</i>

462
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,146
but not too much fun.

463
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,077
That girl's gonna
turn my hair gray.

464
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,179
What happened?

465
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,353
I accidentally
ate some seahorses.

466
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,825
How much?

467
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,155
I don't know.
It's powdered, so...

468
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,130
Like, four or five,
I don't know.

469
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,870
I've got just the thing.

470
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,246
This one is called
"Earthrise on the Moon."
