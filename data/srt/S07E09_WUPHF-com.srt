1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:10,501
DWIGHT: Uh-oh. Okay,
okay, nobody panic.
Listen up, listen up.

2
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,239
Everyone,
follow me to the shelter.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,679
We've got enough
food for 14 days.

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,240
After that, we have
a difficult conversation.

5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,341
My bad.

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,387
Space heater and
fan were both on high,

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,855
plugged into
the same outlet, so...

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,087
JIM: It's saying
the server went down?

9
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,285
Does anybody
know that password?

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,488
'Cause otherwise,
we can't do any work.

11
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,054
Uh, try "password."

12
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,188
Nope.

13
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:35,566
Try zero, zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero.

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:36,959
No.

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,940
Okay, now try zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero, one.

16
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,808
Okay, I'm not
doing every number.

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,368
Wait, does anyone
remember when
it was set up?

18
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,606
Uh, it was, like,
eight years ago?

19
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,372
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> stuff?

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,044
I don't know,
I'm just trying
to think of things

21
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,882
that were happening
at the time.

22
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,546
Everyone was getting
their driver's license.

23
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,651
Why don't we just
call the I.T. guy
who set it up?

24
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,090
What's the name of the guy
in the glasses, again?

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,993
Okay, moving backwards,
our I.T. guys have been

26
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,060
"Glasses," "Turban,"
"Ear Hair," "Fatty 3,"

27
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:08,125
"Shorts," "Fatty 2,"
"Lozenge" and "Fatso."

28
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,071
I think "Lozenge"
is the one
who installed it.

29
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,128
ANDY: I got it.

30
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,262
Try...

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,345
You know what,
it made me laugh
when I heard it,

32
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,404
but Pam got
really offended.

33
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,244
"Big boobs."

34
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,581
"Drama queen"?
"Nosy"?

35
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:26,981
You're typing
"big boobs"?

36
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,110
I'm trying everything.

37
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,315
Try "big boobs"
with a "z."

38
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,390
That's the password.
We're in.

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,586
DWIGHT: All right.
Wow.

40
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,390
DWIGHT: Yes.
The important thing is

41
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,522
this kept us secure, people.

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,524
Morning.
RYAN: How's it going?

43
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,888
Hey, I'm Wuphf.
I'm Facebook.

44
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,955
What's up, Facebook?

45
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,399
I sent you
a Facebook
message yesterday,

46
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,959
I still haven't
heard anything back.

47
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,766
You should've
sent me a wuphf.
A what?

48
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,069
When you send a wuphf,
it goes to your
home phone, cell phone,

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,234
email, Facebook,
Twitter, and homescreen.

50
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,299
All at the same time.

51
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,172
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Wuphf.</i>

52
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,182
Wuphf!
Wuphf.com!

53
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,491
Thanks, Erin.
Sure.

54
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,724
Hey, Pam. I don't
wanna be a lousy snitch.

55
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,453
Okay.

56
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,932
Ryan has been
using the color printer
for his business a lot,

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,990
and as office
administrator...

58
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,058
Oh, it's okay.

59
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,832
But it's not for...

60
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,099
Let it go.

61
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,970
PAM: <i>Yes, I invested</i>
<i>in Wuphf.</i>

62
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,473
It's actually
a really great idea,

63
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,602
and I can't believe
it didn't exist before.

64
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,342
And I know Ryan's
kind of a sketchy guy,
but hey, I married Jim.

65
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,476
I've done my part
for the nice guy.
Now I want a bedroom set.

66
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,155
I think an investors'
ski trip, frankly,
is the best idea.

67
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,054
It will be
a bonding experience.

68
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,114
I love it.

69
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,455
I was looking
at a trail map,

70
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,428
and I was thinking
that we should start
on a bunny hill,

71
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,157
because I've never
actually been skiing.

72
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,965
And then work our
way up to "Death Drop."

73
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,036
Great,
so we got our first offer
to buy the company.

74
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,161
You're kidding.

75
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,673
We could sell,
but why think so small?

76
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,873
We can just get
a couple more
people involved,

77
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,206
really do this
thing our way.

78
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,437
You and me, baby.

79
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,811
New investors are key,
though. That's actually
why I came in today.

80
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:36,909
Don't you work
here full-time?

81
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,013
Today, I was
thinking I would sit down
with a few of the people

82
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,555
who haven't invested yet.

83
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,455
Or we could do that
together, if that
sounds fun to you.

84
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,883
That does sound fun to me.

85
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,984
Awesome.

86
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,760
Oh, this is good hay. Yeah.
This is the good stuff.
Mattress quality.

87
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,270
Every fall,
growing up,

88
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,829
my Uncle Eldred
used to build us a maze
out of hay bales

89
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,274
for us kids to play in.
We called it "Hay Place."

90
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,541
<i>Eldred called it</i>
<i>"Hay World."</i>

91
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,478
<i>Eventually, lawyers</i>
<i>were brought in. But...</i>

92
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:12,110
That's all behind us.
Hay Place lives on.

93
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,175
Watch it, watch it.

94
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,654
Hello!
Welcome to Hay Place.
A place for hay.

95
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,056
Don't forget
to make a broom.

96
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,856
Oh, the petting zoo
closes at 2:00,

97
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,123
and the goat roast
is at 3:00.

98
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,528
Come on in, enjoy!

99
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,788
Hey.

100
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,230
I'm kind of in the mood
for a roll in the hay.

101
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,861
Roll in the hay, $5.

102
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,734
No, I meant...

103
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,065
Oh, our contract.

104
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,199
Mmm-hmm.

105
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,546
Yes, why don't we
meet at the usual spot.

106
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,844
Uh, I've got a half
an hour during lunch

107
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,614
in between the historical
reenactment of the
Dunmore farm slaughters

108
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,813
and the onion boil.

109
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,953
Perfect.
So... Excuse me,
get off of there.

110
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,389
Those are show bales,
not play bales.

111
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,793
All right, thank you.
I will send the
contracts over right away.

112
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,229
All right.

113
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,631
Whoo!

114
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,866
JIM: <i>I am on the first hot</i>
<i>sales streak of my life.</i>

115
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,635
I think it all comes
from feeding Cece,

116
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,234
because no matter
how much she resists,

117
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,371
I sell her
those carrots.

118
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,436
And let's be honest,

119
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,416
if I can make mushed carrots
seem better than a boob,

120
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,085
I can pretty much
sell anything.

121
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,282
Commission comes out to

122
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,717
zero.

123
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,693
Okay, well, it can't
be zero, Kev.

124
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:32,699
I entered the sale,
and I hit enter and I
said, "Dunh-duh-na-dah!"

125
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,163
I'm pretty sure
I timesed it right.

126
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,999
You met your
commission cap
last week.

127
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,006
So, from here until
the end of the fiscal year,
your commission will be zero.

128
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,401
What are you talking about?
We have a commission cap?

129
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,838
It's a new
corporate policy.

130
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,776
Is this job really
about the money
for you, Jim?

131
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,176
I mean, isn't this
where you fell in love?

132
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,744
A commission cap
takes away my
incentive to sell.

133
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,086
So, you realize
I now have no
reason to work, right?

134
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,822
When you're dealing
with a large organization,

135
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:03,227
sometimes you have to
put up with policies
you don't like.

136
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,028
I wish my gym
didn't allow full nudity
in the locker room.

137
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,428
Okay, some of
these old guys
walking around naked,

138
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,561
feels almost
passive-aggressive.

139
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,564
But I deal with it
'cause it's policy.
See what I mean?

140
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:15,798
Nope.

141
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,538
Nudity makes me
uncomfortable.
Okay.

142
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,512
My gym allows it.

143
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,482
I wish they didn't,
but it's policy. So,
I respect it, and I just

144
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,041
keep a low...
You know, I look away.

145
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,385
Think about your
commission cap

146
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,117
as a naked old man
in a gym locker room.

147
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,753
Excuse me,
everyone. Sex!

148
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,863
Now that I have
your attention...

149
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,489
You don't have
our attention.

150
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,589
Money!

151
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,690
I'm listening.

152
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:42,963
You had me at "sex."

153
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,795
Pervert.
PHYLLIS: You have
all of our attention

154
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,237
just by screaming anything.

155
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,529
That's good to know.

156
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,973
What do you want
to say, Michael?

157
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,136
Wuphf!

158
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,374
All right,
I've warmed them up for you.
You have the floor, Ryan.

159
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,875
How's everybody doing?

160
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,540
RYAN: Good!

161
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,246
Now, a lot of you
have already staked out

162
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,788
your corner of
the Wuphf empire.

163
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,222
Raise your hand if
I'm describing you.

164
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,650
Great.

165
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,022
STANLEY: <i>Yes, I have a dream.</i>

166
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,030
And it's not some M.L.K.
dream for equality.

167
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,195
I want to own
a decommissioned
lighthouse.

168
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,430
And I want to
live at the top.

169
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,032
And nobody knows
I live there.

170
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,772
And there's a button
that I can press,

171
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:29,213
and launch that
lighthouse into space.

172
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,780
For my current investors,
things are going great.

173
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,114
We already
have a buyer.

174
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,176
Really? Who?

175
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,552
Washington University.

176
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,282
I don't even want to
think about selling

177
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,882
until our numbers
get into the billions.

178
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,949
At least.

179
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,996
So, I've decided
to open up a second
round of investment

180
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,827
to friends and family.

181
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,025
Oh, God. Hold on to
your wallets, ladies.

182
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,627
Did you ever think of
Wuphf as an emergency
notification system,

183
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,866
like, for college campuses
with shooters or gas leaks?

184
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,373
No, no, Oscar, it's not
a digital rape whistle.

185
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,105
Wuphf is about fun.
That's right.

186
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,976
Fun, communication,
connection.

187
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,439
What's your
money situation?

188
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,447
Well, it's tight,
as with any start-up.

189
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,747
Sure, how long can you
sustain this without
a cash infusion?

190
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,153
We have nine solid days.
I love these questions.
Keep 'em coming.

191
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,316
I'm sorry,
nine days until what?

192
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,381
Bankruptcy?

193
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,428
Wait, Ryan,
so this could be
over by the weekend?

194
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,291
How long do you
think a week is?

195
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,128
No, not this weekend.
Next weekend.

196
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,758
We were gonna go on
the investors' ski trip.

197
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,703
I bought poles.

198
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,239
JIM: <i>Well, since I have</i>
<i>no incentive to sell,</i>

199
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,247
<i>I've cleaned my car,</i>
<i>organized my desk,</i>
<i>and taken a multivitamin.</i>

200
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,747
<i>So...</i>

201
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,576
What now?

202
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,680
Pam.

203
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,023
Okay, now I've tried
everything.

204
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,259
Did you prank Dwight?
No.

205
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,419
Well, you like that.

206
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,759
Yeah, it's not
as fun if I'm not
blowing off work.

207
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,525
I love you,
but I'm kind of busy,

208
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,500
so I need you to
figure this one
out on your own.

209
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,813
Oscar said Wuphf
only has enough money
for nine days.

210
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,711
Check this out.

211
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,511
All that color.
MICHAEL: Look at that.

212
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,883
Triple your
investment by January.

213
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,218
Anyone can just
throw numbers up
on a chart.

214
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,518
What are you doing
to make it happen?

215
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,717
Well, earlier today,
I was emailing someone
by the name of John Legend.

216
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,228
MICHAEL: There you go.
You have his email?

217
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,891
A lot of these
guys are just Mac.com
at their website whatever.

218
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,627
We get that guy wuphfing,

219
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,857
it's all over.

220
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,233
I want my money back.

221
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,067
Do not talk
like that, Stanley.

222
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,039
Ryan, just tell
us your plan.

223
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,811
Okay, all right.
I know what you wanna see.
I'll be right back.

224
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,613
Hey, kids,
was that fun?

225
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,676
ALL: Yeah!
All right.

226
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,517
I wanna go
on it again.

227
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,955
Oh, I bet you do.

228
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,181
You know what?

229
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,523
When I was a little kid,
they couldn't get
me off the hayride.

230
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,028
But it's gonna cost
you three more bucks.

231
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,397
Wow! This brings
back memories.

232
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,027
Hay stacking,
hay throwing...

233
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,541
And at the end of it all,
one lucky boy would
be crowned hay king.

234
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,441
I always wanted
to be hay king.

235
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,240
But the world
shines on Mose.

236
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,348
Where have you been?
I've been waiting.

237
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,053
Can we move this to
the end of the day?

238
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,884
No, I think you should
make time for it.

239
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,516
I found the needle
in the haystack!

240
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,857
Hey, congratulations.
Do you know
what your prize is?

241
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,917
I don't know.

242
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,499
Nothing. Life lesson?
Some tasks are
not worth doing.

243
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,623
Dwight?

244
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,761
Wuphf T-shirts.
Who wants one?

245
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,033
Just imagine that
you're at spring
break at Daytona Beach.

246
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,096
Here we go.
Okay?

247
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,733
Everyone's like,
"Hey, dude, what's up

248
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,005
"with all the hotties
in the Wuphf shirts?"

249
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,706
Or, "Hey, what's up
with that helicopter?"

250
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,307
"It's Ry from Wuphf!"

251
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,406
"It's Ry,
the Wuphf guy!"

252
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,542
"Yo, Ry from Wuphf!"

253
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,109
"He's up there."
"What's he dropping?"

254
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,882
"Wow, what's falling
on us, man?"

255
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,352
Wuphf condoms!

256
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,352
Fifty thousand condoms
out of the sky.

257
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,414
MICHAEL: Look at that!

258
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,585
He threw 'em
on the ground!

259
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,459
Look, this is
a marketing campaign.
You got nine days.

260
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,691
Let's say you
do get the money.

261
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,754
What are you
gonna do with it?

262
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,494
The first lesson of
Silicon Valley, actually,

263
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,503
is that you only
think about the user,
the experience.

264
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,096
You actually don't
think about the money.
Ever.

265
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,700
That sounds weird.

266
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,367
No, it's not weird,
Andy, and you
know what else?

267
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,742
We have an offer from
Washington University.

268
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,178
So, monetize that.

269
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,239
Are you guys
meeting about Wuphf?

270
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,444
You know that that
was my idea, right?

271
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,077
I said to Ryan,
"I try to call you,

272
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,143
"and you don't
have your phone.

273
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,689
"I try to I.M. you,
and you're not online.

274
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,850
"I wish there was
a way that I could do
everything all at once,

275
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,223
"and I could
just be like this
little dog going,

276
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,818
"'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Ruff! Ruff!'"

277
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,157
RYAN: Baby, baby, baby...
KELLY: I think
I'm gonna sue you.

278
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,219
No, no, no.

279
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,356
I do, I do.
This isn't right.

280
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,332
I help you with your
things, and you help
me with my things.

281
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,866
KELLY: But I...
It's not right.

282
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,960


283
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,638
Is it any particular branch
of Washington University?

284
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,833
The Washington University
Public Health Fund.

285
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,245
W-U-P-H-F.

286
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,302
Oh, God.

287
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,813
They only want it
for the initials.

288
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,542
The domain name.
Yeah, they do.

289
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:57,982
I move we sell.
MICHAEL: What?

290
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,519
Yeah, sell.
Sell.

291
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,576
Get us out of this.

292
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,121
Have some faith
in this idea.

293
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,815
If everybody
wants to sell,
we sell, right?

294
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,121
I won't sell.
And you know what?

295
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,855
Ryan and I have
the majority of shares.

296
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,760
Isn't that right?
Yes. You alone do, actually.

297
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,820
I... Yes.

298
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,121
We're not selling.

299
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,963
I will not sell.

300
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,598
Awesome.

301
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,433
Do you mind if we
share this bale?

302
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,671
Sure.

303
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,873
There's no charge
to sit on the hay,
is there?

304
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,510
Probably.

305
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,246
I mean,
wouldn't you think

306
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,014
the $10 to
build your own broom
would include the hay

307
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,350
and not just
the instructions?

308
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,411
I mean,
I'm starting to think

309
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,082
this guy is just
trying to make money
off the holiday.

310
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,722
Yeah, instead of
"Hay Place" it should
be "Pay Place."

311
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,851
Don't laugh at me.

312
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,793
No, no, no, I wasn't.
I was just laughing
at your joke.

313
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,590
Oh.

314
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,431
"Pay Place."

315
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:55,942
Yeah, so we can celebrate
"Thanksgiving-me-your-money"
Day.

316
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,102
That's humorous.

317
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,166
Thank you.

318
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,375
KEVIN: You guys know
how to get out?

319
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,610
Hi, Michael.

320
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,554
Can't talk,
saving the planet.

321
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,056
Oh, we don't recycle.

322
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,552
We don't?

323
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,959
Well, why have I been
separating the trash
into whites and colors?

324
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,721
I'm sure no one
asked you to do that.

325
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,834
Eight years.

326
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,161
Listen, I know you
really like Ryan...

327
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,934
No, I won't
even consider it.

328
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,903
Michael, I...

329
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,738
I hate to say
this, but...

330
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,442
You know this special
bond that you've
always felt with Ryan,

331
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,984
where, like,
you're best friends

332
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,610
or you're his
mentor or something?

333
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,680
Right, yes, yeah.
Best friend/mentor.

334
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,089
Michael, I think
that that feeling
only goes one way.

335
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,154
And I think that
Ryan knows that,

336
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,664
and he's taking
advantage of you.

337
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,728
I think you are wrong.

338
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,930
And there are
a lot of other people

339
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,066
in this office who
have money at stake.

340
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,507
Other people
you care about.

341
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:12,445
You may be right.
I may be crazy.

342
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,644
Don't.

343
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,756
I'm just saying that
I think I agree
with your point.

344
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,652
Yeah, but in a jokey way
where you're
gonna start singing.

345
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,092
I thought it might
make me feel better.

346
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,063
Okay. Go ahead.

347
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:32,437
<i>But it just</i>
<i>may be a lunatic</i>

348
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,871
No.

349
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,406
Ooh, nice.
Wasting time,
here we go.

350
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,379
Hey, back off.
It's solitaire.

351
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,337
Hey, kid.

352
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,106
Hear you're
looking for work.

353
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,173
Talk to me.

354
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,776
How far can you
reach those lovely
long arms of yours?

355
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,278
Put 'em down.

356
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,588
How long can you hold
that pretty little
breath of yours?

357
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,051
Good.

358
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,829
Hey, Jim?

359
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,399
Are you distracting
these people?

360
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,456
CREED: We're working.

361
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,338
Can you at least
try to look busy?

362
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,172
JO: <i>The moment Darla</i>
<i>put the cupcake</i>
<i>in her mouth,</i>

363
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,801
<i>her daddy pulled</i>
<i>her aside and said,</i>

364
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:14,746
<i>"You're too fat.</i>
<i>No one's gonna like</i>
<i>you if you're too fat."</i>

365
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,978
<i>The next time I</i>
<i>saw David Geffen</i>
<i>was at the Buffalo Club.</i>

366
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,579
<i>"I love you,</i>
<i>you gay bastard," I said.</i>

367
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,352
<i>"You gay bastard," I...</i>

368
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:26,782
<i>Gay ba...</i>

369
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,689
<i>Gay...</i>

370
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,960
Michael,

371
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,592
how's it going, bro?
Good, good, bro.

372
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,569
Hey, thanks so much
for having my back
out there.

373
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,128
Always have your back.

374
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,935
So, any ideas on how
we can get over this
nine-day hump here?

375
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,672
I have nothing but
ideas. The thing is,
they all require money.

376
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,542
Nine days, though.
That's, like...

377
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,946
Look, I know I've
tapped you so hard.

378
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,084
Yes, you have tapped this.
Hard.

379
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,952
You are funny, Michael.

380
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,023
You... People don't
give you enough credit.

381
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,352
Maybe I could take
a second mortgage
on my condo.

382
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,193
Well, a lot of
people are doing that,

383
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,694
and there don't seem
to be any consequences.

384
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,288
And they say the rates
have never been lower.

385
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,163
So, you would think
that's a good
idea for me to do?

386
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,170
Think about this,
you and me on
our private plane,

387
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,302
flown by our
private pilot,

388
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,707
eating our private meal,
cooked by our private chef.

389
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,678
Yeah, well, we never even
have dinner now, so...

390
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,802
We totally should.

391
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,904
Tonight?

392
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,374
I gotta work on this.

393
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,248
Right.
What am I saying?
Rain check.

394
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,947
Yeah.

395
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,323
<i>And now, by show of</i>
<i>applause, we will crown</i>
<i>this year's hay king.</i>

396
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,193
<i>All in favor</i>
<i>of Purebred.</i>

397
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,197
<i>Put your hands</i>
<i>together for</i>

398
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,731
<i>Mixed Bred.</i>

399
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,235
<i>And let's hear it for</i>

400
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,802
<i>Purebred.</i>

401
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,767
<i>We appear to</i>
<i>have a three-way tie.</i>

402
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,176
<i>I have no choice</i>
<i>but to pick</i>
<i>the hay king myself.</i>

403
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,541
<i>I pick...</i>

404
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,711
<i>Me! I am your hay king!</i>

405
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,014
<i>All hail your hay king!</i>

406
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,859
Did I truck 300 bales
of hay to a parking lot

407
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,454
to rectify some
childhood disappointment?

408
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,358
Yes.

409
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,229
So, if I were to
call Dunder Mifflin

410
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,294
and ask for
Miss Angela Martin,

411
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,862
would I get
through to you?

412
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,832
You would.

413
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,141
And if I were to
call your house
and ask for your wife,

414
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,271
would I get
through to you?

415
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,375
My wife passed away
a few years ago.

416
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,414
How tragic.

417
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,851
Very sorry to hear that.

418
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,910
Thank you.

419
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,592
KEVIN: Help! Hello?

420
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,153
Oh! Help!

421
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,433
Consider it
a wuphf in person.

422
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,835
You're doing
the wrong thing.

423
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,135
You're gonna lose
Michael's investment,
you're gonna lose ours.

424
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,698
You got this crazy
opportunity to get
our money back.

425
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,136
Tell Mike to sell.

426
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,179
If you tell Michael
to sell, he'll sell.

427
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,337
I'm betting on myself.

428
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,746
It's a bad bet.

429
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,806
Hello?

430
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,217
Hey. It's an ambush here.

431
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,777
Nobody here
believes in
this company.

432
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,878
Will you tell
them they're wrong?

433
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,351
It's not that
we don't believe
in the company.

434
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,517
We don't
believe in you.

435
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,184
All those in favor
of selling, say "aye."

436
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,793
Aye.
Aye.

437
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,851
Aye.
Aye.

438
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:18,824
Aye.

439
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,265
Do not agree to sell,
which is to say nay.

440
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,865
What is wrong with you?
What happened to
you in high school?

441
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,135
Michael, are
you that blind?

442
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,040
I'm not blind!
I know exactly who he is.

443
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,674
He is selfish and
lazy and image-obsessed,
and he is a bad friend.

444
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,019
And he's also clever.

445
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,751
And he shoots
incredibly high, and
he may just make it.

446
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,456
But you know what,
even if he doesn't,

447
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,654
I would rather
go broke betting
on my people

448
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,825
than get rich all by
myself on some island
like a castaway.

449
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,333
And there is
no middle ground.

450
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,563
You're gonna lose
all of our money.

451
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,208
Only if he fails.
And you know what?
Ryan, I believe in you,

452
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,770
just like I believe
in all of you.

453
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,342
You have nine days
to save everybody's money.

454
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,142
Oh, that's a lot
of pressure.

455
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,050
I'm gonna need
some more time.

456
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,514
You can't have it.

457
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,385
Okay.

458
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,751
I won't let you down.

459
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,005
Angela? Angela!

460
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:46,076
The world sends
people your way...

461
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:51,318
Ryan came to me
through a temp agency.
Andy was transferred here.

462
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,859
No idea where
Creed came from.

463
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,323
The point is you
just have to play

464
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,556
with the cards
that you're dealt.

465
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,687
Jim,

466
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,364
<i>that guy is an ace.</i>

467
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,494
<i>Dwight is my</i>
<i>king up my sleeve.</i>
<i>Phyllis is my old maid.</i>

468
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,867
<i>Oscar is my queen.</i>

469
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:09,136
That's easy.
Give me a hard one.
That's what Oscar said.

470
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,173
<i>Toby is the instruction</i>
<i>card you throw away.</i>

471
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,803
<i>Pam is a solid seven.</i>

472
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,678
<i>And yeah, you know what?</i>
<i>Ryan is probably, like, a two.</i>

473
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,844
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>twos can be wild,</i>
<i>so watch out.</i>

474
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,250
And I am obviously
the joker, so...

475
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:26,848
That's...

476
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,095
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Wuphf from Ryan Howard.</i>
<i>Decided to sell company.</i>

477
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,690
<i>Thanks, bro.</i>
<i>Hell of a ride.</i>

478
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,292
Thank God.

479
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,435
Gabe Lewis.

480
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,443
JO: <i>Now, listen here,</i>
<i>Gabe, you're too fat.</i>

481
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,644
<i>No one's gonna like</i>
<i>you if you're too fat.</i>

482
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,745
<i>I made some</i>
<i>changes to my book.</i>
<i>See if you like them.</i>

483
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,722
Well, Jo...
<i>Now, I love reading,</i>

484
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,122
<i>and I hate being</i>
<i>interrupted.</i>

485
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,921
<i>Shut up and listen,</i>
<i>you gay bastard.</i>

486
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:06,261
<i>Chapter one. I was born,</i>
<i>not into luxury nor poverty,</i>

487
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:09,097
<i>but into adversity,</i>
<i>and for that,</i>
<i>I thank the Lord.</i>

488
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,228
<i>My father was a man.</i>
<i>That's all we can know.</i>

489
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,296
<i>After I learned</i>
<i>to ride a bike,</i>
<i>there was no stopping me.</i>

490
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,309
<i>I would ride up</i>
<i>Magnolia Street</i>
<i>and down Azalea Lane,</i>

491
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,708
<i>which would later</i>
<i>become my paper route...</i>

492
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:19,837
All right,
good night, Gabe.

493
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,244
Just wanted to
say thanks again

494
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,804
'cause I really
think I made
good use of my day.

495
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,680
<i>...wherever I wanted.</i>

496
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,480
<i>I have always</i>
<i>been a fighter.</i>
Sorry.

497
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,722
<i>And fate has obliged me</i>
<i>with plenty of battles,</i>

498
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,848
<i>the first being a hard...</i>
