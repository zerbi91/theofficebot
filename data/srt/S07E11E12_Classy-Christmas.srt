1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,171
Got it.
All right.

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,273
Okay, let's go in.
I'm freezing.
People, wait, wait, wait.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,638
Come back, come back.
One fun one.

4
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,006
We're gonna do a fun one.
Okay.

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,773
One <i>Charlie's Angels.</i>
One. Let's go.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,872
Okay,
this is just a Christmas card
from your paper supplier.

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,109
No one's putting
this on their fridge.

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,243
I got it, you guys,
how about this.

9
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,547
Michael, what if all the boys
are on one side,

10
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,916
all the girls
are on the other.

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,254
The boys are, like,
"Why, I ought to..."

12
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,657
And the girls are, like,
"Let's go shopping."

13
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,157
Let's just jump in the air.
That's it!

14
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,856
That's a picture!
Yes! Jump in the air.

15
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,229
We're gonna jump in the air.
Here we go.

16
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,326
Okay, one, two, three.

17
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:37,761
Not everyone jumped.

18
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,433
Okay, everybody jump
in the air this time, please.

19
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,565
Here we go.

20
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,270
One, two, three.

21
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,242
Still some people not jumping.
You gotta be kidding me.

22
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,248
Who isn't jumping?
I'll tell you who.

23
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,944
Darryl, Phyllis,
Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.

24
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,042
I am jumping.

25
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,815
You are?
Let me see you jump.
Yes, I'm jumping.

26
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,286
Oh, my God. This is
a store-bought camera.

27
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,189
This isn't one of those
special military-grade cameras

28
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,420
that would be
able to capture that.

29
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:01,553
I'm freezing.

30
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,688
Also, Erin is
jumping way too early.

31
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,958
She's on the ground
by "three."

32
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,125
I didn't want to miss it.

33
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,100
Well, if we all jump
really high,

34
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,796
we'll be in the air longer.
Do that.

35
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,361
Here's a question
nobody's asking,

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,838
is this worth it?
Don't answer that.

37
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,374
People,
listen up and listen good.

38
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,535
We need to just
get one picture

39
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,636
where we're all in the air
at the same time. Yes?

40
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,010
Why?
I believe in us.

41
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,173
We can do this.

42
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,217
Okay, on three,
everyone in the air.

43
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,746
Three, two, one, zero.

44
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,880


45
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,585
We didn't get it.

46
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,549
<i>I'm the office</i>
<i>administrator now,</i>

47
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,954
which means I'm
basically being paid

48
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,991
to be head of the
party planning committee.

49
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,056
The first thing I did
as head, I shut it down.

50
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,723
<i>At its worst it was</i>
<i>a toxic political club</i>

51
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,996
<i>used to make others feel</i>
<i>miserable and left out.</i>

52
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,033
At its best
it planned parties.

53
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,934
It hardly looks fake.
It's so lush.

54
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,270
Why does it smell real?

55
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,167
JIM: Ah!

56
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,869
Good one.

57
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,809
Ho, ho, ho!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

58
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,650
Merry Christmas,
little children!

59
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,780
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

60
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,519
How's everybody doing today?
PAM: Good.

61
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,126
How's the party coming along?
Great.

62
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,460
Are we over budget?
Nope.

63
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,699
No? Good.

64
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,429
Did anyone
get drunk already?

65
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,697
Not yet.
Good for you.

66
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,605
Angela, lay it on me,
what's the problem?

67
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,467
Nothing. Should be fun.

68
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,104
So, Stanley,
how big is the bug
up your butt today?

69
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,011
Pam got those
sugar-free cookies I like.
I'm doing fine.

70
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,744
All right, well,
I will be in my office

71
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,345
making toys for
the good children.

72
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,056
Andy?
Yeah?

73
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,658
What you got?

74
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,253
It's all good, Santa.

75
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,724
Well, that's a relief.

76
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,095
Santa's gonna take
some much-needed free time.

77
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,729
All right. Good!

78
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,736
MICHAEL: <i>My kids</i>
<i>are growing up.</i>

79
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,701
<i>As a boss, I look at that</i>
<i>and I say, "Great."</i>

80
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,607
It is exactly what a boss
would hope would happen

81
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,235
because that's what I want.

82
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,280
That's what
every boss wants,

83
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,908
is a wonderful Christmas
with no drama.

84
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,051
It's present time, you guys.

85
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,262
Happy holidays from
your friends at Sabre.

86
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,456
We just want to say
how grateful we are.

87
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,692
Sabre is actively looking
for ways to involve me

88
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,735
as minority executive trainee.

89
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,099
So I suggested choosing
the annual Christmas gift
to the employees.

90
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,140
And they said,
"Oh, yes. Perfect.

91
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,302
"Thank you, Kelly. Finally,
something for you to do."

92
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,239
It's a Hello Kitty
laptop sleeve.

93
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,679
Hello Kitty's for girls.

94
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,409
Nashua got mp3 players.

95
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,145
Yeah, I don't even
have a laptop.

96
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,881
I wonder if these
presents would be under
as much scrutiny

97
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,388
if I were white.
WOMAN: Wow.

98
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,980
Come on.
I said "I wonder."

99
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,650
I didn't say "I think."

100
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,227
Kelly, I thought we agreed
on fleece blankets.

101
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,054
Blankets?
What am I, five?

102
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,929
Erin and I make
great use of ours.

103
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,625
Yes, Erin and I
are still dating.

104
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,965
Why do you ask me so often
if we're still dating?

105
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,831
I'll take one of
those pink pouches.

106
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,771
I feel good today.
My little girl Jada?

107
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,404
It's my turn to have her
for Christmas this year.

108
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,143
Two years ago I had her,
and we had the best time.

109
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,650
I've TiVoed her
favorite shows,

110
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,253
some things
I've never heard of.

111
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,886
<i>iCarly...</i>

112
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,648
You know who's funny
on that show?

113
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,190
The friend with
the video camera.

114
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,391
He's got a nice
way of talking.

115
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,529
Hey, it's snowing.

116
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,296
DWIGHT: Oh, my God!

117
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,067
It's the first snowfall
of Christmas.

118
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,072
Is that just so magical
for you, little girl?

119
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,804
Can you not wait to
have a hot chocolate,

120
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,439
and cuddle up with Papa
and tell him about all
your Christmas dreams?

121
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,207
It's not even a real snow.

122
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,684
Look, it's a dusting.
It's pitiful.

123
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,128
Hey, Dwight.

124
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,057
MEREDITH: Yes!

125
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,060
Damn it, Jim,
you cannot throw
snowballs in here!

126
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,933
Well, it's not a snowball,
'cause it's only a dusting.
Right?

127
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,533
Look at that.
There's a pebble in there.
You could have killed me!

128
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,010
Don't be such a baby.

129
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,774
Yeah,
who's a little girl now?

130
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,051
You apologize to me
right now.

131
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,313
You've got something
on your nose.

132
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,082
You apologize right now.

133
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,154
No.
Very well,

134
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,688
then I challenge you
to a snowball fight

135
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,124
on the first
real snow of winter.

136
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,027
You got it.

137
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,864
That sounds awesome.
Can we all do it?

138
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,665
No, Andy,
it's a snowball fight.

139
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,203
It's not fun.
Go get your own thing.

140
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,464
Beat it.

141
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,440
Jim, let go.

142
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,378
Angela, are you bringing
your new boyfriend
to the party?

143
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,348
I wouldn't subject
Robert to that.

144
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,415
He's a very busy senator.

145
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,755
State senator.

146
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,728
I would not expect you
to know what it's like

147
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,196
to date someone in
the public arena.

148
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,561
Who are you dating
in the public arena?

149
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,360
The senator.
Oh, right.

150
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,732
The state senator.

151
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,832
We went to a picnic thrown
by the comptroller's wife.

152
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,672
Oh.
That would be impressive

153
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,113
if anyone knew what
a comptroller was.

154
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,678
Well...

155
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,615
Do you have any idea
how many photographers
there are

156
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,519
at a ribbon-cutting ceremony?

157
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,115
I do. Two.

158
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,122
"Angela...

159
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,856
"Angela... Here.
Look here!"

160
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,296
Before we kick off the party,
I just want to remind everyone

161
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,358
that an office party
is just that...

162
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,630
Yeah!
A party.

163
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,098
It's not an excuse
to get really drunk

164
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,301
or confront someone
or have a cathartic experience

165
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,707
of any kind.
MICHAEL: Pam?

166
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,301
Pam?
Pam?

167
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,844
Wow, there are questions
to that. Okay.

168
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,940
You know what,
no questions.

169
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,613
Last item on the agenda,
Toby would like to
make an announcement.

170
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,315
Hi, guys.
Hi.

171
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,383
I just wanted to
let you know

172
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,258
that I'll be taking
a leave of absence
starting next week.

173
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,558
Because you've
been on the lam?

174
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,859
Because the boring police
have been after you,

175
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:46,922
and they finally
caught up with you?

176
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,057
No, the opposite.

177
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,333
I was actually selected
to be a juror on a very
high-profile case.

178
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:57,002
Yes, the case of the
horrible red-headed sad sack.

179
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,305
And the verdict, it was Toby.

180
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,247
And the sentence, death.
Death to Toby!

181
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,741
DWIGHT: Death to Toby!

182
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,809
Okay, that's hurtful talk.
We've talked about that.

183
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,615
You know, I don't interrupt
your announcements.

184
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,986
You leave these huge pauses
in your sentences.

185
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,115
What do you expect me to do?

186
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,420
What's the case, Toby?

187
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,585
Well, I really can't
talk about it,

188
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,855
but it's a very
high-profile case.

189
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,362
Is it criminal?
Yes.

190
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,997
Have we heard of it?
I don't know.

191
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,726
Is it the middle school
teacher who tried

192
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,700
to turn her foreign exchange
student into a sex slave?

193
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,703
Come on.
Was it the post office guy

194
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,136
who rubbed his penis
all over the mail?

195
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,333
Guys,
it's a really big deal.

196
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,308
He's rubbing his neck.
He's rubbing his neck!

197
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,469
He's rubbing his neck.

198
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,703
Scranton Strangler!

199
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,911
I can neither
confirm nor deny this.

200
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,179
Let's just say
I'll be up to my neck
in jury duty.

201
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,818
That was the worst joke ever.

202
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,689
Corporate will be
sending someone else
to take my place.

203
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,285
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.

204
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,057
Holly Flax.
She comes from
the Nashua branch.

205
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,428
What? What?
Yeah.

206
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,588
She'll be starting next week.

207
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,792
If you have any
questions about

208
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,926
the transition,
just let me know.

209
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,560
Hold on,
Holly's coming back here?

210
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,332
Yeah.
Guys, who's Holly?

211
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,269
MICHAEL: That is a great
question, Erin.

212
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,368
How do you describe somebody
who is at the same time

213
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,846
an old friend,
and was a lover.

214
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,781
And was a complicated part
of my past,

215
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,787
and maybe, just maybe

216
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,379
a part of my future?
Wow.

217
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,788
She's one sassy black lady.

218
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,157
Holly's coming back,
everybody, and we have to
have a party.

219
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,957
I'm not sure
the temporary replacement

220
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,691
of an HR rep
really warrants a party.

221
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,563
You know what,
we'll postpone this party
until then.

222
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,100
This is too important.
Cancel this one.

223
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,196
Dwight, get rid of the tree.
Okay.

224
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,738
Cancel. We're canceling it.

225
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:34,797
No, don't throw them out!

226
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:35,931
No, we have to
cancel the party.

227
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:36,999
We can save that!
No, no, no.

228
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,909
We're gonna get
fresh for Holly.
Fresh and new.

229
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,207
I know.
These cookies are fine!

230
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,613
It's not. They're not.
Michael, wait.

231
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,843
We don't have...

232
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,909
We don't have the budget
for another party.

233
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,920
Well, then,
everybody will chip in.
It'll be fine.

234
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,855
I honestly think
you're idealizing people
here again, Michael.

235
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,358
I don't think
that's gonna happen.
You know what,

236
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,360
I'll pay for it.
I'll pay for the party.
It doesn't matter.

237
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,158
This is way too important.
People, Holly's coming back,

238
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,596
and this is the most
important Christmas party
of my life.

239
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,430
So back to work.

240
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,097
Man, I worked hard.
I worked so hard for this!

241
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,973
I was after
corporate constantly.

242
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,067
I emailed Jo.
I wrote letters.

243
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:15,343
And you know who
I end up owing this to,
is the Scranton Strangler.

244
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,874
Thank you. Thank you,
Scranton Strangler.
I love you!

245
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,254
You just took one more
person's breath away.

246
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:32,131
MICHAEL: <i>We have always had</i>
<i>good Christmas parties here,</i>
<i>as you know,</i>

247
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,962
<i>but they've never been cool.</i>

248
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,261
The name is Bond. Santa Bond.

249
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,898
I'll have an eggnog,
shaken, not stirred.

250
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,439
Classic Brosnan.

251
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,871
Santa. Wonderful tradition.
Everybody loves Santa.

252
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,210
Everybody can't get enough
of the jolly old man.

253
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,408
But that is a myth,
because you know what,

254
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,214
he is not necessarily
a big fat guy with a beard.

255
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,911
He's not
necessarily an old guy.

256
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,753
No one knows what
the real Santa Claus... God!

257
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,453
Could you just stop
moving your calves so much
while you're talking?

258
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,257
Well, this year's
gonna be different.
We're gonna have fun.

259
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,194
It's not gonna be tacky.
It's going to be...

260
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,359
You know what,
the food is
going to be austere.

261
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,166
It is not going to be tacky,
deli platter food.

262
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,796
It's not gonna have a big,
fat, gross Santa Claus.

263
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,932
It's gonna be a cool,
sleek Santa.

264
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,508
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend.

265
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:17,942
Okay. Sure.
I'll invite him.

266
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,172
I mean,
unless there's any chance

267
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,508
there could be press
at this party.

268
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,843
You never know
about the press.

269
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,248
Well, I only ask
because he's a senator.

270
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,785
Could he help us with
some parking tickets?

271
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,945
I don't think
that's appropriate.

272
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,215
Well,
then he's not a senator.

273
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,813
Yes, he is.
Okay.

274
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,187
Hey.
Hey.

275
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,522
We still doing
the gifts today?

276
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,689
I mean,
it is the Christmas party.

277
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,990
Well,
the classy Christmas party.
Yes.

278
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,567
But don't get too excited,
'cause I didn't have
a lot of time this year.

279
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,728
Me neither.
Okay.

280
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,830
I've been working
forever on Jim's present.

281
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,570
He always gives me
the best Christmas gifts.

282
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,611
He'll take a memory
or a private joke,

283
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,208
and he'll create
something totally unique.
I love them.

284
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,878
So this year
I made him something.

285
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,178
A comic book.

286
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,187
It stars Jimmy Halpert,
a mild-mannered paper salesman

287
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,726
who, while riding his bike
through the forest,

288
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,921
is bitten by
a radioactive bear

289
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:12,193
and becomes "Bear Man."
Wreaks havoc on the office.

290
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,961
It's really good.

291
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,613
Okay.

292
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,223
No, no, no, no!
Fake tree. No!

293
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,419
No, it has the little...
Pam, no, no.

294
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,984
Holly's coming
from New Hampshire.

295
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,690
Somebody from New Hampshire
looks at that and thinks
it's a burning cross.

296
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,257
No, no. I want you to
go and get a real tree.

297
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,194
Take some money. Thank you.

298
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,761
Hi, I'm looking
for Michael Scott.

299
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,429
Yes, that's me. Come on in.

300
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,902
There's nothing classier
than boring jazz music,

301
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,379
I am here to tell you.

302
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,075
And I made a bit
of a judgment call.

303
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,277
I hired one musician,
because I thought,

304
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,014
"What's better,
to hire an entire quartet
for half an hour,

305
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,079
"or one bassist
for the entire day?"

306
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,258
Hey, any volunteers
to come with me to
go buy a Christmas tree?

307
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,995
I would, but I don't
want to get dirty.

308
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,032
There might be
girls at the party.

309
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,366
Why do you always
think that girls
are gonna be at the party?

310
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,102
No one invited girls.
It's just us.

311
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,635
I will help.
Although my brid, my hybrid,

312
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,146
my Prius hybrid,
won't fit a tree.

313
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,179
Which is ironic,
considering how
many trees it saves

314
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,977
on a daily basis.
KEVIN: Yeah.

315
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:44,046
I do, however, have a hookup
with a dude who has a pickup.

316
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,216
Do you mean Darryl?
That's a great idea.

317
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,453
I'll ask him.
You know Darryl?

318
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,655
Yeah. He works here.
We all know him.

319
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,995
I should come along,
just 'cause he's my,
you know, he's my hookup.

320
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,123
Cool.

321
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,896
Come on, now, Justine, look.

322
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,034
Listen, look, I've been
planning this, okay?

323
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,665
You cannot do this, Justine.
<i>I'm not doing it!</i>

324
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,573
<i>She told me she wants</i>
<i>to have Christmas here.</i>

325
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:04,975
She did?
<i>Yes.</i>

326
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,411
<i>She wants to be around</i>
<i>family for Christmas.</i>

327
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,470
DARRYL: <i>I don't know.</i>

328
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,317
I thought I was enough
family for my daughter.

329
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,555
Don't come in, I'm busy.

330
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,157
It's cool, Darryl,
I'm here, too.

331
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,919
Hey, sorry, I really
didn't want to come in.

332
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,790
It's just that we have to
go buy a new Christmas tree,

333
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,853
and we're hoping
we could borrow your truck.

334
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,323
Uh. No.
Come on, it'll be fun.

335
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,527
We could do donuts
in the snow on the way back.

336
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,196
No. Thank you for your
interest in my truck.

337
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,835
Okay. Sorry.
We'll leave you alone.

338
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,639
Hey.

339
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,309
You know what?
I could use
a breath of fresh air.

340
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,280
Let's do it.

341
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,979
When Holly gets here,
I want you to be
very helpful to her.

342
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,217
I've looked her up online.
There's nothing about her.

343
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,690
She's made no impression
on the Internet.

344
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,853
She doesn't need
an Internet presence.
You just know.

345
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:57,855
Hey.

346
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,159
What the hell
are you doing here?

347
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,561
You're supposed to
be in the courthouse.

348
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,795
We're on recess.
I came for the party.

349
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,496
Hey, everyone.
KEVIN: Hi, Toby.

350
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,832
What does the Strangler
look like?

351
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,339
Is he gorgeous?
He looks gorgeous
in the drawings.

352
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,502
Yeah.
That scowl.

353
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,876
I can't talk about it
or I'll get removed
from the jury.

354
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,040
And then he will come back
here and replace Holly,

355
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,708
so stop asking him questions.

356
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,878
I know people are only
this excited to talk to me

357
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,580
because of the trial.

358
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,656
But they talk to me
for a while,

359
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,421
and maybe people realize
I have something to say.

360
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,631
And then one day,
we're just talking.

361
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,270
<i>You've reached the voice mail</i>
<i>of Dwight Kurt Schrute.</i>

362
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,434
<i>Please leave...</i>

363
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,123
Stop!

364
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,028
I have no feeling
in my fingers or penis.

365
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,293
But I think it was worth it.

366
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,042
<i>I was laying on the ground,</i>
<i>defenseless,</i>

367
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:23,480
and he just kept throwing them
until he exhausted himself.

368
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,744
And, then...

369
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,255
"How about icing it?
LOL. Dwight."

370
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,022
Hi.
ERIN: Hello.

371
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,657
Is there any way I can
get a hand with these, please?

372
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,299
I'm really sorry,
I can't help you.

373
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,337
I'm waiting for my boss's
pretty friend to arrive.

374
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,235
MICHAEL: There she is.

375
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,867
Hey.

376
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,904
Erin, would you help her,
for God's sake?

377
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,573
You're Holly!
Of course. Sorry.

378
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,913
Hello.

379
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,747


380
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,619
if it isn't Michael Scott.
You old bastard.

381
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,388


382
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,656
around these parts,
you old bastard!

383
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,255
Well, I did show my face
around these parts,
you old bastard.

384
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,867


385
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,368


386
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,459
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk...

387
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,536
D'oh!
Oh, Homey.

388
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,371


389
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,839
Hi. Hi.

390
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,346
Oh, huggy monster!

391
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,408
Oh, not the huggy monster!

392
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,181
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

393
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,846
I don't want to die!

394
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,122
Wow. Well, everybody,

395
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,888
you remember Holly.
Hi.

396
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,725
Did you bring us
anything from Nashua?

397
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,331
Oh, yeah.
I brought some maple candy.

398
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,198
But I have to admit,
I got a little hungry
on the drive,

399
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,327
and I ate some of them.

400
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,528
MICHAEL: That's adorable.

401
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,266
Would you put those out?
To throw out?

402
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,570
Or put out, like,
six pieces for everyone?

403
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,200
Oh, it's so nice to be back.

404
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,802
It looks beautiful in here.
Super-classy.

405
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,971
It's like a party
for limousine drivers.

406
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,950
Well, you came on the day
of our Christmas party.

407
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,418


408
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,784


409
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,050
We love it here.
Don't you love it?

410
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,422
All right, let me show you
to your desk.

411
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,552


412
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,893
HOLLY:
Watch out for my guns.
They're both loaded.

413
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,025
What kind of guns
do you have? Six-shooter?

414
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,431


415
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,904
This feels like you
never left. Doesn't it?

416
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,439


417
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,343
Oh, God.
Oh, and you have a Woody.

418
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,048
Oh, I love...
A.J. gave me that.

419
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,616
Well, that's understandable.
Still raw.

420
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,785
Woody your favorite character?
Mmm-hmm.

421
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,758
You know who my
favorite character
in <i>Toy Story</i> is?

422
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,454
Andy's mom.
Why?

423
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,189
Because without Andy's mom,
there's no plot.

424
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,356
And without any plot,
there is no movie.

425
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,965
That is a really good point.

426
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,061
A.J. said he hadn't seen
any of the <i>Toy Story</i> movies.

427
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,729
You're kidding me.
No. I know.

428
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,899
I'm like, "What?
Are you serious?"

429
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,840
What a douche bag!
Get a life!

430
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,204
Get a...
Yeah, good riddance.

431
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,039
We sat down and we
watched them all in one day.

432
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,141
Now he's the biggest
<i>Toy Story</i> fanatic ever.

433
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,446
Good for him.

434
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,282
Next day I found him
in my bed.

435
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,720
Really? That's creepy.

436
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,223
How did A.J.
get in your house?

437
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,859
We live together.

438
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,522
Oh, you do?

439
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,690
He had a little note
pinned to him that said,
"You've got a friend in me."

440
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,240
Yeah,
Randy Newman's the best.
Yeah.

441
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,571
I love him.
Me, too.

442
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,941


443
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,074
<i>Won't you be my</i>
<i>Christmas tree?</i>

444
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,618
Hey, how about this one?

445
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,180
Ah! Seems a little
full of itself, right?

446
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,278
Kind of a pretty boy.

447
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,454
What if we got
a really beat up one,
like on <i>Charlie Brown,</i>

448
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,151
and we just loved
it for what it is?

449
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,250
Maybe. I mean...

450
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,796
No, she be talking
to your mom or something.

451
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,889
This is my
daughter too, Justine!

452
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,100
You seem to think...

453
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,531
Pick a damn tree already.

454
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,707
Hey, listen, Darryl,
it's none of my business,

455
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,269
but if I couldn't
have Cece for Christmas,
I'd be really upset, too.

456
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,612
I don't have kids
or anything,

457
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,717
but if my
grandmother ever dies,
I'm going to kill myself.

458
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,589
Jada don't want to
spend Christmas with me.

459
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,317
She told her mom it
wasn't as much fun.

460
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,190
How could she say that?

461
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,197
You know,
I took her to the toy store
to buy her own presents.

462
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,898
Well, Darryl, no kid
wants to buy their own
Christmas presents.

463
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,397
Her mom wants me
to take her to mass.

464
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,665
I guess that's
something to do.

465
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,175
No, you should have
her mom do the boring
Christmas stuff on her time.

466
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,472
You should be associated
with the fun parts
of Christmas.

467
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,110
How do I do that?

468
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,938
Bring her to the party.

469
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,710
Yeah, we'll have Santa,
and we'll play games with her.

470
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,615
It'll be a lot of fun.
Yes!

471
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,517
You'll be Mr. Christmas
by the end of the night.

472
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,749
Hey, guys, the tree's here.
Hey.

473
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,292
Nobody hug me.
I'm covered in tree sap, so...

474
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,523
Why would someone hug you?

475
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,759
Hey there, Jada.
Nice to see you again.

476
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,267
I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.

477
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,459
Are you serious?

478
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,671
It's a sophisticated take.

479
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,998
He doesn't look
like Santa Claus.

480
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,335
No, he doesn't.

481
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,508
I told her
Santa would be here.

482
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,547
Yeah, well, I was told
that Holly would be here,

483
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,809
single and ready to date.

484
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:23,941
And we all got misled.

485
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,142
Who told you that?

486
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,914
Nora Ephron,
in every romantic
comedy ever made.

487
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,248
So is it an open relationship?

488
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,115
Oh, God, no.

489
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,488
Well, you're almost 40.
Oh, do you not want kids?

490
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,588
Oh, I want kids.
I really want kids.

491
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,860
But A.J. and I are
practically engaged.

492
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,092
We talk about
spending our lives together.

493
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,228
So where's the ring?

494
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,463
Kelly!

495
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,535
How are you
adjusting to the move?

496
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,733
Nobody cares about that.

497
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,642
Look,
you have to make him commit,
or kick his butt to the curb.

498
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,906
You guys,
I don't think any of us

499
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,948
are really qualified
to be giving Holly

500
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,643
personal advice
about her love life.

501
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,550
Yeah, I mean,
maybe Holly's not
in any position

502
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,713
to be shooing guys away.

503
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,458
I don't get it. I'm sorry.

504
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,460
I just... I don't get it.

505
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,796
Okay, listen,

506
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,596
I'm gonna tell him
that if he doesn't propose
by the end of this year,

507
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,658
we're over.

508
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,868
Wow, an ultimatum.
Yeah.

509
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,138
It doesn't
really seem like you.

510
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,801
That is a great idea.
Ultimatums are key.

511
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,743
Basically,
nobody does anything
for me anymore

512
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,508
unless I
threaten to kill myself.

513
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,122
Don't... Stop. Dwight!

514
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,693
Dwight, stop!
Oh, no. Oh, no!

515
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,358
Stop!
Oh, no.

516
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,732
Yes, taste my wrath!
Okay. Okay...

517
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,032
You like that?
Seriously!

518
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:53,867
Okay. Okay.

519
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:00,108
Yes, I have a wig
for every single
person in the office.

520
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:06,084
<i>You never know when you're</i>
<i>gonna need to bear a passing</i>
<i>resemblance to someone.</i>

521
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,855
I just want it to stop.

522
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,213
So cool, right?

523
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,792
There's no connection
between the origin
story and the quest.

524
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,849
Okay.

525
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,418
We need to know
who Jimmy Halpert was

526
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,758
before he was
bitten by the bear.

527
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,856
Otherwise it's
the bear's quest.

528
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,567
Okay, well,
I just sort of meant,
like, cute, right?

529
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,794
Well,
did you come here for help,

530
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,599
or did you come here for me
to tell you how great it is?

531
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,466
I mean, help,
if it's something simple,

532
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,667
like add page numbers
or laminate it or...

533
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,371
It sounds like you
know what you want.

534
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,777
It's also a little derivative
of a serial called <i>Bear Man.</i>

535
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:35,871
Did you look that up?

536
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:36,938
No.
Okay.

537
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,375
Oh, Jim. Hey.
Hey, Toby.

538
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,854
There's this
female stenographer
at the courthouse...

539
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,357
No way.
Who looks exactly like you.

540
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,120
That's incredible.
Yeah. No, it's uncanny.

541
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,787
You know what's crazy?
I can't reconnect
with you right now.

542
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,728
Hold on one second.

543
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,763
Excuse me.

544
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,018
<i>I guess there are</i>
<i>just some people</i>

545
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,181
<i>who you stay together with</i>
<i>when you transfer,</i>

546
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,656
and some people you don't.

547
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,215
And that's just the way it is.

548
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,892
<i>And I can be</i>
<i>mature about that.</i>

549
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,835
It's so cold.
Even with my coat on.

550
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,570
Maybe your senator boyfriend
has a blanket in his car

551
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,182
for screwing Americans.

552
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:46,650
Yet another opportunity
where a blanket
would have come in handy.

553
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,420
You guys,
this has to stop.

554
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,853
Someone could have
really gotten hurt.

555
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:53,222
What if Meredith was taking
her smoking break
below that window?

556
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,760
You know what
would have happened?

557
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,989
The shards of glass
would have shaved
her face right off.

558
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,256
And, yes,
it might have been funny,

559
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,630
but it also would have
been incredibly tragic.

560
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:02,793
I could not agree more.

561
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,667
And I just want to
state for the record that
I am intending to sue Jim

562
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,434
for acute
psychological distress.

563
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,499
What are you talking about?
You're the one terrorizing me.

564
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,603
With snowballs, Jim?
With fluffy little snowballs?

565
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,441
No. I thought we
were just playing.

566
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,573
Dwight's right.

567
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,675
What you did was dangerous
and inappropriate.

568
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,311
I'm really
surprised at you guys.

569
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,786
Last time I was here,
you were both best friends.

570
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:30,659
All this arguing reminds me
of a very funny story.

571
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,256
You see this on my desk?

572
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,626
You know who gave me this?

573
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,933
My girlfriend Tara,
who lives in New York City.

574
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,267
DWIGHT: Wait,
what girlfriend?

575
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,669
I haven't told you about her.

576
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,841
I find that unlikely.
You email me when
you get a new zit.

577
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,209
I'm a man in my mid-40s
and I still get zits.

578
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,747
I think that's
pretty interesting.

579
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,579
But you know what,
I am not on trial here,
the Scranton Strangler is.

580
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,482
So anyway,
we have this great weekend,

581
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,214
and she drives
me to the airport,

582
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:59,054
and we get to JFK,
but I'm flying
out of La Guardia.

583
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,820
So we laugh and
laugh and laugh,

584
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,156
and then we spend
the rest of the day

585
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,719
walking around slo-mo
drinking latte.

586
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,665
And at the end of the day,
she gives me this,
and she says,

587
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,703
"Michael, maybe next time,
you should take a cab."

588
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,569
I didn't know you
had a girlfriend.

589
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,540
I do. She is.

590
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,167
Did you see her face?

591
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,505
Well, it seems to me
that there is a person
sitting out there in the annex

592
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,517
that still has feelings
for Michael G. Scott.

593
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,753
And it ain't Tara.

594
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,913
So you went
homemade this year.

595
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,480
Yep.
Yeah.

596
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,286
Money problems.
Is that what this is about?

597
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,925
I mean, oh, dear,
I don't think we
can help you out.

598
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,966
No, no. Jim had
a great year, actually.

599
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,864
I just wanted to
get your opinion.

600
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,801
Are you good at homemade?

601
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,094
Look at this.

602
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,203
Yeah.

603
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,708
Who did this?

604
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,080
It's obvious to me
I'm not welcome here,

605
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,745
but somebody better
tell me who did this,
or else I'm leaving.

606
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,414
Well, I don't think
Erin seems to like you.

607
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,253
That's not true.

608
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,986
I don't know her enough
to make a decision even.

609
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,823
What happened?
What happened?

610
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,659
Toby, what did you do?

611
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,759
I think Toby's very jealous
of all the attention
you've been getting.

612
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,424
No, I would never ever
do anything like that.

613
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,300
But it does seem like
something you would do.

614
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,168
Oh, really? Turn it on me.

615
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,738
Well, isn't that nice?
Thank you very much.

616
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,640
Wait, wait, guys, listen.

617
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:29,877
<i>Toy Story</i> is all about
toys that come to life
when people aren't looking.

618
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,818
You don't think...
It's not possible

619
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,312
that Woody did
this to himself?

620
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:37,817
MICHAEL: It is Christmas.

621
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,257
No, it really seems like
something Michael would do.

622
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,796
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
Well, the fact that
you would think that

623
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,627
points to the possibility
that it is probably not me.

624
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,160
And that I have been framed.

625
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,461
Why would anyone
frame you for that?

626
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,265
Okay, I'm sorry,
why are we discounting

627
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,805
this whole
"Woody came to life"
thing so quickly?

628
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,410
Surprise!
It was part of the party.

629
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,647
Pretty funny, huh?

630
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,182
You think this is funny?

631
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:07,609
I don't.

632
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,156
But someday I think
we will laugh about this.

633
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,158
When we tell our kids...
Yikes.

634
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,527
Oh, my God.
All right! Shh!

635
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,695
Okay. You know what,

636
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,130
Holly, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

637
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,535
An accident borne
of jealous feelings.

638
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,973
Michael,
you have to let this go.

639
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,771
I'm with someone else.
I don't feel that way anymore.

640
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,035
Oh, really?

641
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,170
Well,
you certainly seemed jealous

642
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,408
when I told you
about my fake girlfriend.

643
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,813
That's what Jim
and Dwight thought.

644
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,409
Okay, hey, hey, hey...
No, fake girlfriends
are always wrong.

645
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,478
You made up a fake girlfriend
to see if I'd get jealous?

646
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,649
And you destroyed a gift
my boyfriend gave me?

647
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,953
What is the matter with you?

648
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:52,728
When you got transferred,
and I drove you up to Nashua,

649
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:56,324
you said,
"Michael, I love you,
but I can't do this."

650
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,736
But then, with this other guy,
you don't have any problem

651
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,467
with a long-distance
relationship, do you?

652
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:03,773
And you know what,

653
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,072
that is what is
the matter with me.

654
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:12,514
Michael, I'm sorry...
And we did this whole
stupid party for you.

655
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,581
No.

656
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,594
You guys,
it wasn't my fault.

657
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,096
Nothing is ever your fault.

658
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:34,198
Just like when you
ate those maple candies
that you brought for us!

659
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,345
I really think
you're better off.

660
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:45,849
Mmm. Erin, would you do me
a favor and find my street
clothes for me, please?

661
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:46,976
Yeah.

662
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,755
Is she an amazing cook
or something?

663
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,770
"Hey, Pickles,
Merry Christmas.
Open immediately?

664
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,231
"Love, Swiss cheese."

665
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,607
Damn it, Dwight!

666
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,009
Didn't think your
affectionate nicknames

667
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,417
would be your undoing,
did you, Jim?

668
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,818
Let that be
a lesson to you all.

669
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,789
So do they bring in food,
or do you get to go out?

670
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,226
No, they bring it in.

671
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,990
You lucky son of a bitch.

672
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:35,431
I have been trying
to get on jury duty

673
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,993
every single year
since I was 18 years old.

674
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:43,767
To get to go sit in
an air-conditioned room
downtown, judging people

675
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,834
while my lunch is paid for...

676
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,847
That is the life.

677
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,010
Daddy, I'm bored.

678
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,451
Can I read my book
in your office?

679
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,485
Sure, sweetie.

680
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,362
Jada, Darryl,
I'm so glad I found you guys.

681
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,965
A Grinch stole the star
from on top of
the Christmas tree

682
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,024
and is hiding it in
the warehouse somewhere.

683
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,065
You want to go
help me find him?

684
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,068
Oh, my goodness.

685
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:33,550
I am the mean old Grinch.

686
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,288
The little girl who wishes
to win back the Christmas star

687
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:43,627
must first succeed
at these challenges.

688
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,866
That sounds fun
and Christmasy,
you mean old Grinch.

689
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,465
What kind of challenges?

690
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,410
Something like
an obstacle course,
Mr. Grinch?

691
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:58,815
No. You must answer
topical political questions.

692
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:04,749
How many congressmen
is the state of
Pennsylvania guaranteed?

693
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,891
And what other state
has the equal number?

694
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:10,888
I don't know.

695
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,521
Do you know the other state?

696
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:16,328
Maybe the Grinch hid
the Christmas star,

697
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,862
and we could ask for clues,

698
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,097
and he'll tell us
if we're hot or cold.

699
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,309
The star has been hidden.

700
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,403
Is the little girl
hot or cold?

701
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,312
Well, it turns out
she's burning up

702
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:34,683
because the star is
right behind her ear!

703
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,687
And the game's
over seconds later.

704
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:38,815
I'm so glad you could come.

705
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,880
It's nice. I know.

706
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:44,126
Hey, everybody,
this is my boyfriend,
Senator Robert Lipton.

707
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,390
Hi.
Senator, it's an honor.

708
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,831
I'm Angela's friend Oscar.

709
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,500
Oscar. A pleasure.

710
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,096
Robert seems great.
He's very handsome,

711
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,869
firm handshake, he's gay,
good sense of humor.

712
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,179
Hi.
Hello.

713
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,551
I'm A.J.,
I'm here to see Holly.

714
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:11,918
It's kind of a surprise.

715
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,460
I know who you are,
and I think you should go.

716
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:17,458
I bet you didn't even
bring us anything, did you?

717
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,665
Was I supposed to
bring you guys something?

718
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,063
What? A.J.!
Surprise.

719
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,860
What are you doing here?

720
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,461
I wanted to see you.
Oh, my God.

721
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,905
How are you?
Wow! Nice.

722
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,806
Oh, God, you look great.

723
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,276
When did you get here?

724
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,006
Just now. Just now.
Hey.

725
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,809
Hey, Michael.
Good to see you again, A.J.

726
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,543
Welcome.
Pleased to see you.
Thank you.

727
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,313
Good trip down?
Yeah, it was great.

728
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,047
Good, good.
Good to see you.

729
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,390
Have fun. Enjoy the party.

730
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,823
I am dead inside.

731
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,725
What do you want, baby?
We got some granola,

732
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,824
got some cupcakes,
chips, apples, pies.

733
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,299
You have a whole room
of vending machines.

734
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,133
I know. Isn't it something?

735
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,432
I can't decide what I want.

736
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,744
Merry Christmas.

737
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,019
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

738
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,455
A Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

739
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:24,092
A Merry Christmas.

740
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,798
Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas.

741
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,596
And Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.

742
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,837
Merry Christmas.

743
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,462
Oh, thank you.

744
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,242
For your feet.

745
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,005
It's amazing.

746
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,912
It's so great. Thank you.

747
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,847
For me?
Yes.

748
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,614
Thank you very much.

749
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,897
I don't know if you
guys have had a chance

750
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,440
to use the new parking meters
that accept credit cards,

751
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,203
but Robert was instrumental
in that legislation.

752
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,776
Wow, that's awesome!

753
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,343
A real David
and Goliath story.

754
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,645
I'm just so touched
that she's so interested
in my work.

755
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,144
ANGELA: I am.

756
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,016
MEREDITH: The real problem
is the teachers' union.

757
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,453
Zip it, Meredith.
No.

758
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,922
You tell me why my kid is 17
and still can't read.

759
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,617
Hey, who's in charge
of making drinks around here?

760
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,591
Is there a bartender?
You are.

761
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,856
You make your own drink.

762
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,093


763
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,794
An F train to Brooklyn.
Extra bitters.

764
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,061
I don't know
how to make that.

765
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,537
Okay, well, I'll just
stick with my Mojito.

766
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,105
And you know
those annoying
geese at the park?

767
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,074
Well, he's helping
eradicate them as well.

768
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,173
I mean, I think
they've really become a pest.

769
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,235
Annoying.
Yes.

770
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,282
I don't think
he's in the ceiling, babe.

771
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,548
Well, I don't think
any of us really know.

772
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,960
All right.

773
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,200
Is it...

774
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,173
Is it pebbles from
that beach in Jamaica?

775
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,071
Go easy with the shaking.

776
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,987
Oh, my God.

777
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,420
You like it?

778
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,320
I love it.

779
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,661
Yep, I do make
great Christmas gifts.

780
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,192
But I couldn't make that.

781
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,031
All right, my turn.

782
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,437
Oh, it's just... I didn't...

783
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,566
I didn't have a lot of time,
so that's just a place holder.

784
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,235
Right. Of course.

785
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,111
<i>"The Adventures</i>
<i>of Jimmy Halpert."</i>

786
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,512
Oh, my God.

787
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,121
This is awesome!

788
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,588
That's my bike.

789
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,118
That's my desk.

790
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,129
And that is my daughter.

791
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,631
I mean...

792
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,039
I don't like
to talk about it.

793
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,142
Better office policy up there.

794
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,377
KEVIN: But it should be
the same policy as us.

795
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,017
Okay.

796
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,754
Michael, wait.

797
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,758
Hey, hey, no, don't run.
You're gonna slip.

798
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,159
That's good advice.
Yep.

799
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:52,329
I read this story
about a woman who slipped
on some black ice,

800
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,100
and she hit her head
and went into a coma forever.

801
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,804
And then every day,
her husband went

802
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,402
and visited her in
the hospital until she died.

803
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,607
That's a sad story.

804
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,249
Yeah, well,
at least he was married.

805
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,452
Okay, Michael, slow down.

806
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,951
Everything's gonna be okay.

807
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,382


808
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:16,124
Oh, man,
I can tell you confidently
that it is not gonna be okay.

809
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,324
I shouldn't tell
you this, but...

810
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,592
A.J. won't commit to Holly.

811
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,564
And she's gonna tell him
that if he doesn't propose
to her

812
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,438
by the end of the year,
it's over.

813
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,733
Really?

814
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:33,936
Really.

815
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,917
And I don't know about you,
but I don't know
a lot of happy marriages

816
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,214
that start off with
an ultimatum. Do you?

817
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:43,913
No.

818
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,883
So just be patient.

819
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,019
Yeah. I mean,
I can wait till then.

820
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,967
Come here.
I don't want you to fall.

821
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,639
I surrender.

822
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,770
I do not accept
your surrender.

823
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,211
There's only one way
that I would ever relent.

824
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,105
Anything. You got it.

825
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:14,814
You hit Pam in the face with
a snowball while I watch.

826
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,117
You're a psychopath.

827
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:18,518
I'll take that as a no.

828
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,753
I was in the mall,
and I saw that,

829
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,658
and I thought it had
your name written all over it.

830
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,925
Michael, this is the gift
that corporate gave us
that I picked out.

831
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,990
You're re-gifting this to me.

832
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,929
No, that's not...

833
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,941
No, I went to the mall
and I picked that out
especially for you.

834
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:38,033
Oh, yeah?
Well, show me the receipt.

835
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,970
From the mall.

836
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,474
That...

837
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,780
This is a fast food
receipt from April.

838
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,178
That...

839
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:49,949
God, how many number nines
did you order?

840
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,718


841
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:57,858
I think everyone's
on edge because of
the Strangler trial.

842
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,955
Hey, I'm so glad
you came down.

843
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,665
It's been so much
harder than I expected.

844
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,928
Hey, what happened to Woody?

845
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:08,435
Oh, okay, get ready for this.
You're not gonna believe it.

846
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,409
I was making salad,
and he fell right
into the dressing.

847
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:15,208
I mean,
there was salad
dressing all over him.

848
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,714
He smells awful.

849
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,282
It was blue cheese dressing.

850
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,779
Great.

851
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,721
Hey, Mike.
Hey.

852
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,019
We wanted to
give you something.

853
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,285
Merry Christmas.

854
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,055
Thank you.
A Hostess apple pie!

855
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,461
This is my favorite breakfast.
How did you know that?

856
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,690
Thank you very much.

857
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,901
What do you say?
You're welcome.

858
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,437
Oh, you know,
I seem to remember

859
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,200
that Santa promised
that he would listen

860
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,934
to all the gifts you
wanted for Christmas.

861
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,031
Didn't he say that?

862
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,098
Yeah.

863
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,106
I think I know where he is.

864
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,742
A trampoline.
Mmm-hmm.

865
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,578
Video games.
Video games.

866
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,777
DSi.
DSi.

867
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,480
A horse.

868
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,815
A pool.

869
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,913
Are you sure you
don't want a pony?

870
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,183
You want a real horse?
Yes.

871
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:04,161
All right. You have
to pick up after them.

872
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,130
Hey, sorry. I'm ready.

873
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,124
I don't want to go.

874
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,796
Oh. Come on, Bear Man.

875
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,734
Come on.

876
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,079
Have you ever
seen them do that?

877
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,190
I'm sorry.

878
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,524
I had no idea.

879
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,258
No, it's okay.

880
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,668
Okay.
Oh, my God.

881
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,565
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.

882
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,611
Okay, this is it.
What?

883
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,274
Go! Go! Go!
What? What is it? What?

884
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,612
Oh, my God!

885
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,546
Honey? Jim?

886
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,921
Jim!

887
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:21,297
In the end,
the greatest snowball
isn't a snowball at all.

888
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,968
It's fear.

889
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,676
Merry Christmas.
