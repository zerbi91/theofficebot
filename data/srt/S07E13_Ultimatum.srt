1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:04,895
Next up, secretary Schrute
will read the minutes
from Sunday's meeting.

2
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,809
"Minutes from
previous meeting,
of Knights of the Night."

3
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,669
No! Jim, hey.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,770
Oh.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,372
This meeting is for
Knights of the Night only.

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,714
Knights of the Night are
volunteer crime patrollers.

7
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,275
We're often compared
to the Guardian Angels,

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,912
but we could not
be more different
from them.

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,855
<i>Seriously, we are nothing</i>
<i>like the Guardian Angels.</i>

10
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,520
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>broad strokes purposes, sure.</i>

11
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,823
<i>Think Guardian Angels.</i>

12
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,660
<i>One of our many</i>
<i>recent good deeds,</i>

13
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,595
<i>we set out to capture</i>
<i>the Scranton Strangler.</i>

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,365
Mission accomplished.

15
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,767
Not by us.

16
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:39,339
I'm actually just
looking for my BlackBerry,
so carry on.

17
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,534
No, no, no, no, no.
I see how this movie ends.

18
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,440
You make fun of me,
everyone laughs.

19
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,704
Ha, ha, ha.

20
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:45,768
Screw you.

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,777
Dwight, don't be bothered
by your friend's presence.

22
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,607
What are you gonna do now?

23
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,744
You gonna make fun
of our leader's
weird voice, huh?

24
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,414
"Dwight, don't be bothered..."

25
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,781
Over the line, Jim.

26
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,391
I'm just looking for my phone,
so pretend I'm not here.

27
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,725
Fine. "Minutes
from previous meeting
of Knights of the Night."

28
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,522
It's our official name, Jim.

29
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,724
Sounds good.

30
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,428
"Reflective strips
were glued to patrol jackets.

31
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,199
"Knights went outside
with flashlights
to test them."

32
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,364
Smart.

33
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,738
And the rest
was just boiler
plate stuff, that's...

34
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,174
Go ahead and read it,
some people weren't here.

35
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,267
Okay.

36
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,041
Knights stayed outside
to play flashlight tag.

37
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,048
Oh, come on.
That sounds awesome.

38
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,645
It was pretty cool.
Was it?

39
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:24,844
It was fun.

40
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,146
It was...
It was pretty awesome.

41
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,749
Hey, yeah. No, I got it.

42
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,625
Just leaving now.

43
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,079
January 3, 2011.

44
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,787
A day which will
live infamously.

45
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:06,084
Holly Partridge Flax,
otherwise known as Holly,

46
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,357
otherwise otherwise known
as a living, breathing angel,

47
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,261
is engaged to another man.

48
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,924
This is freaking me out. I...

49
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,501
Okay, let's just switch
to the happy video, okay?

50
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,870
No, no, no, no.
Let's push through.
We'll do this.

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,034
Today will either be
the best or
the worst day of my life.

52
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,902
Holly gave A.J. an ultimatum.

53
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,470
He either
proposes by New Year's
or they break up.

54
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,539
Now if she's engaged,
I'm gonna go crazy.

55
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,709
And I'm gonna
start attacking people.

56
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,118
If she's not engaged,
in all honesty,

57
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,246
I may just burn
this whole place

58
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,482
to the ground
out of happiness.

59
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,958
Either way, I am going to need
some talking down.

60
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:43,486
And nobody talks me down
like myself in
a video talking me down.

61
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,323
Michael,
I know what you're thinking.

62
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,698
Holly is engaged
to somebody else
and you want to kill yourself.

63
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,794
That may seem like
a good idea, but it's not.

64
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,061
Snot.

65
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,740
Sorry, it sounded like
you said, "It's snot."
I'm so sorry.

66
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,203
Okay, so killing yourself...

67
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,838
I was just
thinking about snot.

68
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,845
Good morning.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,786
Hey, guys. Uh, fun thing.

70
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,484
The index cards on your desk
are resolution cards.

71
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,487
You write
your New Year's
resolution on them,

72
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,228
I'll collect them,
and then display
the cards on...

73
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,901
This. Resolution board.

74
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,132
Wow, did your baby draw that?

75
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,366
The glitter is blinding.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,975
I think it's good.
It's gonna be fun.

77
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,570
I recently met Sue,

78
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,571
<i>the office administrator</i>
<i>at Vance Refrigeration.</i>

79
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,310
<i>She has this awesome wall</i>
<i>full of fun initiatives</i>

80
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,079
<i>and morale boosters and stuff.</i>

81
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,085
Sue just goes for it.
She's awesome.

82
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,290
I know Sue,
she's not that great.

83
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,984
And you know her husband's
in a wheelchair, right?

84
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,129
Okay, champagne.
Happy.

85
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,191
Sponge.
Sad.

86
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,425
To soak up my tears.

87
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,133
Gummy bears and gummy worms.

88
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,406
Bears sad, worms happy.
Come on, Erin.

89
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,269
Ukuleles. Happy?

90
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,604
Sad. Something to break.

91
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,571
Chocolates.
For you, job well done.

92
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,380
Thank you.

93
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,148
And two bottles of scotch.

94
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,277
Both sad.

95
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,485
And did you get the tickets?

96
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,580
I did, I did indeed.

97
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,490
Two front row center
to Paula Poundstone,
live in Poughkeepsie.

98
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,788
Holly's favorite.

99
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,691
I hope she doesn't
call us up on stage,
that would suck.

100
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,125
"Hey, you think you
could do my job better?"
"I don't know."

101
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,191
"What's your name?" "Michael."

102
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,797
I'm really excited
for Michael either way.

103
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:36,435
Because if Holly
chooses to be with him,
he will be so, so happy.

104
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,478
And if not, he'll be
avoiding the biggest
mistake of his life.

105
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,347
Oh, hey, guys.
I'd like to introduce you

106
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,384
to a new little
friend of mine.

107
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,613
His name is New
Year's Resolution Board.

108
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,256
Shut up. Hello.

109
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,349


110
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,418
So, high five me. We're back.

111
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,588
To a happy...

112
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,993
Woo! Look at those.
Mittens. Those a present?

113
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,534
Come on.
They're warm.

114
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,502
Those are so fuzzy and warm.

115
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,395
Let me feel those.
Let me feel that.

116
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,240
Put her there.
Give me a good firm one.

117
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,331
Ooh, that's a good,
firm handshake.

118
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,534
You're hired.

119
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,238
Yes, well let's get right
into the Anderson account,
shall we?

120
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,042
Okay.
Yes, yes, right away.

121
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,810
Yes, yes. Right away.

122
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,941
Okay.

123
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,486
Hey, hey, hey.
Want me to crank the
thermostat to 90?

124
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,488
Smoke her out?
She can't keep those
mittens on forever.

125
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,854
Yes. No, what? Stop. Yes.

126
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,087
Congrat...

127
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,356
Wow.
Oh.

128
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,729
Oh, my God.
That's it, that's it.

129
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,194
Oh, I get it.
Everybody knows
about the ultimatum.

130
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,602
Yes, I told everyone.

131
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,936
Ha, ha!

132
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,239
Hey, right back at you, bitch.

133
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,044
Happy, happy, happy, happy!

134
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,783
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

135
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,484
<i>Okay, calm down! Breathe.</i>

136
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,650
I'm trying.

137
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,023
<i>I said breathe.</i>

138
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,186
I'm trying.

139
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,856
<i>Wait a second.</i>
<i>Are you listening to music?</i>

140
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,954
What?

141
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,431
<i>Shut that off.</i>

142
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,229
I'm not
listening to the music.

143
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,566
<i>Fine, just go crazy</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>

144
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,074
<i>Looking good.</i>
<i>You're looking good.</i>

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,977
<i>I gotcha, I gotcha!</i>

146
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,115
<i>I'm pulling you back!</i>

147
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,279
<i>Michael dance-off!</i>

148
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,612
That's nice. That's nice.

149
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,746
<i>Go!</i>

150
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,948
Me, okay!

151
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,582
Go!
Oh, yeah!

152
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,286
<i>Nice!</i>
<i>We're gonna calm down later.</i>

153
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,887
I'm doing it.
Oh, yeah!

154
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,398
Oh, yeah!
Right there, right there!

155
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,956
Oh, yeah!

156
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,065
Hey, Dwight. I'm
collecting resolution cards.

157
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,128
Not doing that.

158
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,196
Why not?

159
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,969
I've achieved plenty,
and there's no
better than the best.

160
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,136
Drink less caffeine.

161
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,237
That's a good one, Pam.
Here's mine.

162
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,344
"Learn to cook for one."

163
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,078
Yeah, I love cooking.

164
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,882
But I always find
myself throwing out
half the food that I prepare.

165
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,981
So I figured it's time
to just start preparing
the right amount of food

166
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,424
for the right number
of people, which is one.

167
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,685
Well,
maybe you'll meet someone.

168
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,930
No, some people just
don't meet someone.

169
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,931
I'm fine with it. Really.

170
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,466
This is not a pity party.

171
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,502
It's not a party at all.
It's just sad.

172
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,302
Angela.
Yes.

173
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,869
"Make time for romance."

174
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,209
Who's the senator?
My boyfriend.

175
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,071
Oh, you mean
the state senator.

176
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,471
I'm sorry, I was confused
'cause you accidentally
wrote "The senator."

177
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,050
Wait, wait, wait.
It's that easy?

178
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,819
That's not a resolution.
That's just
something I wanna do.

179
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,152
Okay, fine. I can do that.

180
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,659
My resolution is
"Meet a loose woman."

181
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,754
Oh, God.

182
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:46,956
That's a good one.
Yeah?

183
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,228
You know what?
That's my new one.

184
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,428
I'm taking that one, too.

185
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,730
Awesome.

186
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,500
You know what
you guys should do?

187
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,801
Go to the book store at lunch.

188
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,706
There's tons of cuties
and it's easy to talk to them.

189
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,769
"Hey, what book is that?"

190
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,370
"Cool,
let's hang out tonight."

191
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,779
"Sex already? Whoa."

192
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,043
The book store?
It's that easy?

193
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,380
I'll come with you,
show you how it's done.

194
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,681
Okay.
I'll drive.

195
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,722
My resolution is to read more.

196
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,848
And if someone else
is driving me to
the book store,

197
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,519
I can eat my PB
and J in the car.

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,096
2011 is coming up all Darryl.

199
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,466
Hello.
Somebody's got a new phone.

200
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,162
Yeah.
That is neat.

201
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,865
I got it for Christmas.
I'm so out of my league here.

202
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,334


203
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,074
Holly like phone?

204
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,041


205
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,172
Why?

206
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,706
New phone is confusing,
gets bad reception.

207
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,012
Oh, bummer.

208
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,347
Bummer.

209
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,649
Reese's pieces.

210
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,017
Reese's pieces?

211
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,455
KELLY: Oh, God. Please stop.

212
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,589


213
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,031


214
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,062
Hey.

215
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,837
No. Don't go see that one.
I want to see that together.

216
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,038
Yeah, go see that action one.

217
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,071
Okay.

218
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,272
I love you, too.

219
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,849
All right.

220
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,649
Holly doesn't
seem to be engaged,

221
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,986
but she's talking to A.J.
like she is.

222
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,288
I can't figure it out.

223
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,695
Do you think
she's already
dating a different A.J.?

224
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,089
I don't think so.

225
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,724
When you broke it off with Roy
did you still tell
him you loved him?

226
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,060
No.
But you did still love him.

227
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,626
I'm not gonna have...
Do you love him now?

228
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,035
No!

229
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,564
Just talk to her.

230
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,040
No, she'd just resent me.

231
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,373
Or worse,
she would think of
me as her friend.

232
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,174
"Oh, hi, friend."

233
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,811
I'll talk to her, Michael.

234
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,075
You think she'd talk to you?

235
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,207
Why wouldn't she?

236
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,514
That's true,
she's really nice.
She'd talk to anybody.

237
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,849
Why don't you bring
Erin to balance you out?

238
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,950
There's a plan.

239
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,258
All right, we should
divide up by section.

240
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,295
I will take
Romance and Travel.

241
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,126
I'll take the entirety
of the second floor.

242
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,130
I got that cutie
behind the counter.

243
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,002
Well, if you read a lot
you should check
out our e-readers.

244
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,566
They're really neat.

245
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,201
Oh, I work at a paper company.

246
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,974
Those things terrify me.

247
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,879
They could put us
out of business,
you know?

248
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,577
Heard those machines
hold, like, 10 books at once.

249
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,217
Actually, it's 10,000.

250
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,886
Holy . What?

251
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,555
Let me see that.

252
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,448
So light. Like a croissant.

253
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,187
Hi.
Hi.

254
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,889
Welcome.

255
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,522
Let us know if
you need anything.

256
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,292
Thanks.

257
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,492
Why did we pretend
like we work here?

258
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,928
Is that what we were doing?

259
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,197
I don't know...

260
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,495
Hey, how'd you do?

261
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,598
Good. Yeah.
Good, real good. Yeah.

262
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,267
I think we kind of nailed it.
Yeah, pretty much.

263
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,744
But, you know,
this place is kind of
tapped out, so let's roll.

264
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,477
Cool.
Okay.

265
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,742
What'd you get?

266
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,077
A book about oceans.

267
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,345
Oh, really?
What else? Let me see.

268
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,010
That's porn.

269
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,088
Pornography.
Old lady. Nasty porn.

270
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,184
Follow my lead.

271
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,354
Hey, want some company?

272
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,588
Want some company?

273
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,128
Oh, sure. Have a seat.

274
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,227
HOLLY:
How were your breaks?

275
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,769
Oh, really good.
I went to Portugal.

276
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,860
I went to Portugal.

277
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,836
Oh, wow. You went together?

278
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,532
No.
No.

279
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,801
So, I just gotta know.
What's going on
with you and A.J.?

280
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,101
Nothing really happened.

281
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,073
I mean,
I know I made a big deal

282
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,842
about this whole
New Year's deadline,

283
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,215
but, it came and went
and we're still together.

284
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,679
You didn't break up
with A.J. at all?

285
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,018
I mean, not even for a week
to make him buy you a present?

286
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,217
It just wasn't fair of me
to give him an ultimatum
in the first place.

287
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,318
The whole thing is
totally my fault.

288
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,057
But we're gonna be just fine.
Just fine.

289
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,154
BOTH: Hmm.

290
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,005
Whoa!
Hold on.

291
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,234
I am not going back
until I fulfill my resolution.

292
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,038
Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

293
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,269
DWIGHT: Come on, why not?

294
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,971
I've never been in one before.

295
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,448
I'm tired of being
Mr. Perfect Role
Model all the time.

296
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,010
I'm telling you, don't do it.

297
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,176
I got nothing
against strip clubs,

298
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,246
but I do have
something against them
at noon on a Monday.

299
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,458
The day shift at a strip club?

300
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,425
You can't un-see that.

301
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,891
Well, we can't just
go back. I mean,
we came out to meet women.

302
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,256
Hey, there's a roller
rink across the street.

303
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,557
There's always
chicks at the rink.

304
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,862
What kind of chicks
are you gonna meet there?

305
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,131
I don't know.
Single moms at
a skating party?

306
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,405
Sweet 16, 10-year
reunion parties.

307
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,443
Chicks fall down,
need help getting back up.

308
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,444
Roller derby practice.

309
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,437
We're going skating.

310
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,456
The goal of this
meeting is to get

311
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,359
everybody excited
about their resolutions.

312
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,589
Who's been good
about their resolution so far?

313
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,330
Erin, tell us about it.

314
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,668
Well, my goal was
to learn a new
word every single day.

315
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,900
And I must say that
it is going immensely.

316
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,404
Cool.

317
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:01,175
Here's a little "way
to go" gift from Sabre.

318
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,146
Intercepted.
Hey... Gabe.

319
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,240
Oops-e-doops.

320
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,014
Creed, I notice
you don't have
a resolution on the board.

321
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,247
What's yours?

322
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,584
I want to do a cartwheel.

323
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,919
But real casual, like.

324
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,856
Not make a big deal out of it.

325
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,657
But I know everybody saw it,
just one stunning,
gorgeous cartwheel.

326
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,822
How's it going?

327
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,866
I'm having a little
trouble motivating.

328
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,369
One of the hardest parts
about making
resolutions is keeping them.

329
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,763
In fact, most resolutions
are abandoned by February.

330
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,566
Or sooner.
Yeah.

331
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,507
It's not a joke.
But that's okay.

332
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,045
Because it's not
about being perfect,
it's about trying.

333
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,244
In fact,
why don't we go around
and confess some of the ways

334
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,978
that we've already fudged
on our resolutions?

335
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:42,384
Well, I said that I
would eat more vegetables,
and I haven't yet.

336
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,583
But it's okay.
I still have time.

337
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,523
Since last year I ate none.

338
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,528
Okay,
well, my confession is that
today I had a sip of coffee.

339
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,996
But that's fine.
Is it?

340
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,899
Yes, because with
all of your support,

341
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,870
by this time next year maybe
I'll be down to one
glass of iced tea a week.

342
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,430
Next year? Come on.
I mean, what is the point?

343
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,770
What is the point of that?

344
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,537
I made a resolution to floss.
And I did it.

345
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,346
12:01, January 1st.

346
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,910
Bam! Blood everywhere.

347
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,240
Not all of us are
Michael "Freaking" Scott.

348
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,912
What is wrong with you people?
Can't you stick to anything?

349
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,421
Erin, I want you
to go to the kitchen
and get me some vegetables.

350
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,585
Creed, you say you
want to do a cartwheel?
Nothing's stopping you.

351
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,523
Come on, old man.
Do a cartwheel!

352
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,927
Well, I can't.
I don't know how.

353
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,465
You're just going
to somersault around
for the rest of your life.

354
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,058
And you know what's gonna be
on your tombstone? "Loser."

355
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,870
My tombstone's
already made, thank you.

356
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,098
Just do a cartwheel!

357
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,433
This is all I could find.

358
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,632
Eat it.

359
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,738
PAM: You don't have
to do that, Kevin.

360
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,677
Oh, no.
I'm glad this is happening.

361
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,906
Thank you, Michael.

362
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,582
Why are you eating stem first?

363
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,312
This is a new food for me.
How else should I eat it?

364
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,386
GABE: The other way.

365
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,953
Can I get some Cheez Whiz?
Or Hollandaise?

366
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,654
No, no. No Cheez Whiz,
no Hollandaise,

367
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,388
no chocolate sauce,
just eat it.

368
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,159
Come on,
here comes the airplane.
There you go.

369
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,394
Open, open, into the hangar,
there you go.

370
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,129
PAM: Oh, Michael.
Yeah, eat it.

371
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,997
Put it in your mouth,
and just eat it.

372
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,265
God, I hate it.

373
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,967
I don't care
whether you hate it,
you said you'd do it!

374
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,030
Michael, Michael.
All right.

375
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,077
Eat it, eat it!
Oh, my God.

376
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,305
You're killing him, Michael.

377
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,547
All right,
all right, all right! Shh!
ANGELA: Michael!

378
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,877


379
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,015
Let me see if
you swallowed it.
Open your mouth.

380
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,483
Under your tongue. Oh, God!

381
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,651
You guys are pathetic.

382
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,760
Can I get some
candy or something?

383
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,801
No, you can't have any candy!
I'll get him water.

384
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,425
PAM: Okay, Michael.
Just settle down.

385
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,363
PAM: Um...

386
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,067
Oh, God!

387
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,481
MICHAEL:
Holly Flax.

388
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,880
Yes, Michael?

389
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,248
Not Michael, E.T.

390
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,683
What's up?

391
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,486


392
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,256
Oh, no, Michael.
I don't want to
talk about it with you.

393
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,955
And I'm fine, I just...
I don't want to talk about it.

394
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,122
Okay.

395
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,019
MICHAEL: Holly, come on in.
Thanks for coming.

396
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,395
I thought there should be
an HR rep here for this.

397
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,926
So Kevin and Creed,

398
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,834
things got
a little bit intense
in the conference room.

399
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,031
You think?

400
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,333
And I wanted to apologize.

401
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,602
These resolutions
should be about you,

402
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,769
and I made it about me.

403
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,039
And it was none of my beeswax.

404
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,239
You were super mean.

405
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,210
It was insensitive
and I am sorry.

406
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,745
It was traumatizing, Michael.

407
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,982
I wouldn't be surprised
if I never ate
a vegetable again.

408
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:06,588
I really wanted
you to follow through
on your resolutions.

409
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,521
The cartwheel, the veggies.

410
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,390
I...
I care about you. Very much.

411
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,234
And you loom so
large in my heart

412
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,671
that I crossed the line.

413
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,698
Okay, Michael, no offense.

414
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,134
But you need to
get your own life.

415
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,878
You're right.

416
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,214
And I hope that we
can still be friends.

417
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,185
I don't think I'm
there yet, boss.

418
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,614
Well, I am.
Okay.

419
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,115


420
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,488
KEVIN: I'm gonna help you.

421
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,957
Okay, okay.

422
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,695
Hey, it's just you.
Anything you want to hear?

423
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,927
Um...

424
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,571
Dave Matthews Band.

425
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,197
No hits, deep tracks only.

426
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,700
Okay.

427
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,411


428
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,989
RYAN: I just feel blocked.
I feel like I'm living...

429
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,426
Hey, Ryan.
Yeah.

430
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,554
How's your fart
project coming?

431
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,064
That's real,
real classy, Kevin.

432
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,497
Hey, was it me or
you that just shoved

433
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,033
the butt end of
a pound of broccoli

434
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,093
into my mouth
because Michael told me to?

435
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,262
Me.

436
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,463
Kevin, don't.

437
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,473
Come on.

438
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,009
Oh, Pam? Soda. Caffeine.

439
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,337
Yeah, just a little.
I have a lot to
deal with today.

440
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,279
Well, if you don't
have to do them...

441
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,679
Meredith, what are you doing?
I could be pregnant.

442
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,878
Okay, no.

443
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,553
Oh, my resolution was to
get more attention.

444
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,851
RYAN: Nope, she's lying.

445
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,619
KEVIN: Hey, Ryan.

446
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,030
One, two, three.

447
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,130
I did it. I did a cartwheel.

448
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,700
you!

449
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:56,792
Oh, God!

450
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,859
Okay, that's it.

451
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:58,927
God!

452
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,803
Lesson learned.

453
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,450
What's up?

454
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,019
Hey, where'd you go?

455
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,222
To the arcade.
Oh, cool.

456
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,220
Why, did you meet someone?

457
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,690
Yeah. I did, actually.

458
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,857
His name is Andy.

459
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,362
And he roller
skates like a Greek God.
And you know what?

460
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,524
I kind of like
hanging out with him.

461
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,192
Right on, son.

462
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,836
Gentlemen.

463
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,804
And where did you go?

464
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:33,999
Strip club.

465
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,565
I was looking at the strippers
at the strip club.

466
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,844
Right.
So that's it, guys?

467
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,877
If you want I can
put on the strobe.

468
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,986
ALL: Yeah!

469
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,426
Do you want to keep this?

470
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,627
No.

471
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,929
Do you want to keep this?

472
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,165
Yeah.

473
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,570
Do you wanna keep this?

474
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,905
No, you can toss them.

475
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,881
My resolution?
I never want to
make Holly cry again.

476
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,243
Unless it's from
laughing too hard.

477
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,353
Or making love
too beautifully.

478
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,496
HOLLY:
<i>We're gonna be just fine.</i>

479
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,895
You know how
you say something
over and over

480
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,459
and the words
start to sound weird?

481
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,433
Going to be just fine.

482
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,771
Just fine,
just fine,
just fine.

483
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,436
I just think
we need to cool
things down for a while.

484
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,477
<i>Yeah, a break.</i>

485
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,346
<i>At least until I</i>
<i>get back to Nashua.</i>

486
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,945
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

487
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,820
Look at where you're going
to be doing the cartwheel.

488
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,453
So look where
you're going to be
placing your hand.

489
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,054
So pick a spot.
Mmm-hmm.

490
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,864
You ready to do this?
Yes, sir.

491
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,992
You know what?
I'm gonna stay here
as long as it takes.

492
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,627
I really appreciate it.
I'm gonna spot you.

493
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,001
Spot you.

494
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,831
Go.

495
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,737
I did it!

496
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,500
You did?

497
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,567
A perfect cartwheel.

498
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:21,806
Okay, good!

499
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,376
What a rush! That's
all I had to do all year.

500
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,078
Congratulations.

501
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,421
All right.
Well, all right,
see you tomorrow.
