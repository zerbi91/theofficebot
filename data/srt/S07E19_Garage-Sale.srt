1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,640
Hey, Oscar.
Big <i>Will & Grace</i> fan, huh?

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,800
Nope.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,976
Everybody assumes I am.
I always get them as gifts.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,275
Dunder Mifflin
is having our
first ever garage sale.

5
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:17,946
<i>Like many Americans,</i>

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,182
<i>we realized we</i>
<i>had a lot of things</i>
<i>that we didn't really need.</i>

7
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,986
And 10 cents of every dollar
is going into the party fund

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,889
so we can throw parties
for ourselves.

9
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,087
People, look alive!

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,686
It's show time!

11
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:35,327
Doors open in
three, two, one!

12
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,803
Ooh! Yikes!

13
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,774
It's cold, Dwight.
Just shut the door

14
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,437
and let people
come in the front.

15
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,414
It's good that it's cold.
It will drive business inside.

16
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,212
The signs will
drive business inside.

17
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,684
The warmth will
lure people inside.

18
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:52,776
Just close it.

19
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,219
This is how...
I'm not closing the door.

20
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,312
Close the door. Close it.

21
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,721
Close it.
Stop it!

22
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,153
PAM: Kevin, shut the door.

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,359
DWIGHT: Uh-oh!

24
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,871
Looks like someone's
sign's a little crooked.

25
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,064
It looks awful.

26
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,002
Need a thumb tack?
Sure.

27
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,271
Not so fast.

28
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,743
Schrutes are farmers by hobby
and traders by trade.

29
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,242
Through the art
of the swap,

30
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:28,585
I will walk out
of this garage sale
with the finest item here.

31
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,022
I will trade you
for the used candle.

32
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,217
Forget you.

33
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:36,229
Come on.
It's trash, like your sign,
unless you have this.

34
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,257
Fine. Just give it.

35
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,430
That's how it's done.

36
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,504
Whoa! I love her.
How much for that?

37
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,839
I actually don't know
why I brought that

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,606
because it's
kind of priceless.

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,713
Ten dollars.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,749
No. I paid $500 for that.

41
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,278
$200.
$500.

42
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,546
$20.
$45.

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,178
Get lost.
Damn it.

44
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,747
And that is how you do it.

45
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,587
We don't have to sell
that if you don't want.

46
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,887
If it's a problem
with the neon,

47
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,154
I can have my
neon guy take a look.

48
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,719
No, you know what,
it's really more
for a bachelor pad.

49
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,162
I just want to
get a fair price.

50
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,701
Well, we could put it
in storage in case.

51
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,767
In case?
In case of what?

52
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:20,137
You know, in case maybe
something changes.

53
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,569
I don't have an "in case."
Do you have an "in case"?

54
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,870
Nope.

55
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,013
How much for
the Slip 'n Slide?

56
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,514
Get lost.

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,190
Yes, hello, Mr. Flax.
This is Michael Scott,
your daughter's boss.

58
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:41,057
I am calling because
I am going to have to
fire your daughter Holly

59
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,529
because she's such
a terrible employee.

60
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,293
I'm just kidding.

61
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,267
I'm kidding.
I am actually calling

62
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,204
because I'm
in love with her.

63
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,070
I love your daughter,
and I have for some time.

64
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:58,841
And I would like to
discuss my intentions
with you,

65
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,904
which are to ask
her to marry me.

66
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,883
And I was just hoping
that you would give me
your approval.

67
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,318
And this isn't a joke.
So call me back
when you get this.

68
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,415
And I look forward to
speaking. Thank you.

69
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,121
Mmm.

70
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,925
Are you serious?
A half-used candle?
Get out of here, Dwight.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,559
You're blocking my table
with your giant body.

72
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,931
Because there's
a huge line of people

73
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,632
who want your
spinster tchotchkes.

74
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,875
Screw you, man.
People like my stuff.

75
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,200
People like Ryan?

76
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,343
Let me tell you
about men like him.

77
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,813
He comes over and
you're like, "Hey, baby,
let me light a candle."

78
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,749
And you pull out
this one, half used.

79
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:42,415
He's like,
"Who else is she seeing?
I better lock her down fast."

80
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,123
You can take my Helen
Fielding collection.

81
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,821
And the Jennifer
Weiner collection.

82
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,264
Oh, my gosh,
you have the <i>Dallas</i>
board game?

83
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,326
Yeah. When I was a kid,
I was on Dallas.

84
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,564
Really?
Yeah.

85
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,003
We missed our
connecting flight

86
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,507
and we spent
the entire day
on Dallas.

87
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:05,276
Then we spent
a week on Hawaii.
I was on heaven.

88
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,139
We should play it.

89
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,241
Well, there's
no instructions.

90
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,376
It's <i>Dallas,</i> the game.
We can figure it out.

91
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,442
Yeah.

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,853
I'm pretty good
at board games.

93
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,447
Well, should we make it
a little interesting?

94
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,548
Sure.

95
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,797
What is this?

96
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,666
How did those get out?
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,697
"Professor Copperfield's
Miracle Legumes"?

98
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:38,337
I was in Jamaica
and I got lost,

99
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,044
and it was getting
dark this one night
and then out of nowhere,

100
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,447
this guy comes with a cart
and he's selling these.

101
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,777
Dwight, he told me
things about myself

102
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,377
that there's no way
he could have known.

103
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,282
That's a common
swindler's trick.

104
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,789
Probably. Probably.

105
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,061
So I buy some,
I turn the corner,
I feel like an idiot,

106
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,431
so I go back to
get my money
and he was gone.

107
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,631
So you want to
sell me magic beans?

108
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,700
Correction. I do not
want to sell you

109
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,868
"Professor Copperfield's
Miracle Legumes."

110
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,441
Nice try. No, correction,
terrible try.

111
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,350
Michael called Dad?

112
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,285
WOMAN: <i>Your friend, Michael,</i>
<i>yes. What's going on?</i>

113
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,748
Um...

114
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,184
I think I know,
but I'll sound
stupid if I'm wrong.

115
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,250
Is Dad there?

116
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,920
MAN: <i>Hollis?</i>
Hi, Dad.

117
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,556
<i>There was a program</i>
<i>on TV about India.</i>

118
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,001
Okay. Did you
connect with Michael?

119
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,093
<i>You want to watch it?</i>

120
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,772
I'm not there, Dad.
I'm in Pennsylvania.

121
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,035
<i>What... What are</i>
<i>you doing there?</i>

122
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,305
I live here.

123
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,007
Can I talk to
you about Michael?

124
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,447
<i>I'll put your mother on.</i>

125
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,950
No, no, no, Dad...
WOMAN: <i>Holly?</i>

126
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,684
Mom, Dad can't seem to
focus on the subject.

127
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,746
<i>Don't you worry about him.</i>
<i>He's got me.</i>

128
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,348
Well, who do you have?

129
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,623
<i>I have your father.</i>
<i>He's right here.</i>
<i>I'll put him on.</i>

130
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,788
No, Mom.

131
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,191
Oh! Which one's decaf?

132
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,374
Michael! Michael! Hey!
Hi!

133
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,715
Hi, I'm just coming out to
see what you're doing
and maybe stop you.

134
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,947
Ah!

135
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,284
You know what?
Do you have a siphon?

136
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,551
I think I'm going
to run out of gas.

137
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,985
Why do you
need more gas?

138
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,753
Well, I'm writing a message.

139
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,624
Is it a good message
or a bad message?

140
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,591
I'm asking Holly
a question in fire.

141
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,591
Are you proposing?

142
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,659
Maybe.

143
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,763
Wow!

144
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,832
You know what?
I've got gas on my
hands and my shoes.

145
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,902
Would you...
Would you light it?
Do the honors, please?

146
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,879
Yeah. Yeah. No problem.

147
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,643
Pam?
Yep.

148
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,084
Could you light this, please?

149
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:05,250
Michael,
you've had two ideas today,
and one of them was great

150
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,660
and the other
one was terrible.

151
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,692
I am not in the mood
for riddles, Pam.

152
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,822
This is terrible.

153
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,627
No, this is romantic.

154
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,531
You know what?
I'm going to get a hose
and then we'll talk about it.

155
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,661
Okay, we'll figure it out.

156
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,596
I'll be right back.
Just stay there.

157
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,103
Free sample?

158
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,307
My mom makes the
best pesto in the world.

159
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,247
And I always tell her,
"Mom, you should sell this.

160
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,511
"You'd make a fortune."

161
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,678
And she always says,
"No, it's just for family."

162
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,222
Well, finally I was like,
"... it. I'll sell it."

163
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,188
So I'm like, "Mom,
I need you to make
a ton of pesto

164
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,285
"for a pesto party
for all my friends."

165
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,798
She's like, "Okay."
Pesto party? Really?

166
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,665
Anyway, she makes
like 100 bottles worth.
It's so good.

167
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,930
And Phyllis just
had that "mom look"
I wanted.

168
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,205
You got this
kosher certified?

169
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,805
No. I meant like,
"It's cool. It's kosher.
It's all good."

170
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,643
Ryan, you have such
an interesting mind.
So creative.

171
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,156
All these new business
ideas and artistic projects.

172
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,750
Thank you.
What you got there?

173
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,554
It's just
Stanley's old photo album.

174
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,994
I was thinking
about throwing it
in the garbage.

175
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,295
I mean, why would I
want some random black
man's old photo album

176
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,269
sitting on my book shelf?
I'm not James Franco.

177
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,140
Things are going very well.

178
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,574
I traded a thumb tack
for Meredith's junk,

179
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,611
<i>for Kelly's crap,</i>
<i>for Phyllis's garbage,</i>

180
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,011
<i>for Oscar's trash,</i>
<i>for Stanley's crap,</i>

181
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,345
<i>for Ryan's junk,</i>
<i>for Creed's garbage,</i>

182
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,353
for a very cute squid
that Erin happened to have.

183
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,855
Jim, put those away.

184
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,956
I'm really sorry.
Pam must've put those out.

185
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,859
All right,
just out of curiosity,

186
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,454
what were the claims
for those beans?

187
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,265
They're legumes, Dwight.

188
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,359
And you're just
going to make fun of me,
so why would I...

189
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,204
You know what?
This ends now.

190
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,580
Hey, Michael,
everyone's in
the conference room.

191
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,044
Why?

192
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,214
You called a meeting.
I don't...

193
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:17,847
I did?

194
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,786
Okay.
Thank you all for coming.

195
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,989
I would like to
talk to you today
about recycling.

196
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,464
Michael.
Yes?

197
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,501
We are a family.
I could not agree
with you more.

198
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,900
And I've always
believed that we should
all be very involved

199
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,995
in one another's
personal lives in
a very major way.

200
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,062
Yes. Thank you.

201
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,129
So about this proposal thing.

202
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,506
No, no, no, no.
My mind's made up.

203
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,602
I am not going
to change my mind.

204
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,873
You can't
talk me out of it.

205
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,812
Michael,
she's perfect for you.

206
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,941
She's the one.

207
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,542
She's amazing.
This is very exciting.

208
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,352
So we just...
We want to help
you plan the proposal

209
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,724
so that it's safe,
and responsible,
and realistic and doable.

210
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,259
I had a great idea
until you ruined it.

211
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,730
You want to know
how to do it?

212
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,927
Here's how you do it.
Take her out to dinner,
go down on one knee.

213
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,766
If you are in a costume,
you did something wrong.

214
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,762
If at any point,
you find yourself

215
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,706
tying the ring
to a dog's collar,

216
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,801
stop and look at yourself.

217
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,468
Hmm.

218
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,548
I'm going to play me
a little old blackmail card.

219
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,842
Nice.

220
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,509
And call a proxy meeting

221
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:22,113
and take control of
Ewing Oil once and for all.

222
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,754
No, you can't do that.

223
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,520
You can't play
a blackmail card

224
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,356
and call a proxy meeting
in the same turn.

225
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:33,360
Why not?
It seems to me we're
just making up rules

226
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,925
because somebody forgot
to staple the rule book

227
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,836
to the inside of the game,
like a normal human being.

228
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:43,366
And I'm going
to play this here
"share the wealth" card.

229
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:47,380
Which entitles me
to half of both
of you all's money.

230
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,245
So, if you don't mind.

231
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,114
No, this card is
from the wrong game.

232
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,983
This is from
<i>The Game of Life.</i>

233
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,146
It was in the box.

234
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,587
Well played.
Thank you.

235
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,681
We must honorably
adhere to the rules

236
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,386
that we are
making up on the spot.

237
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,025
No, but that's not fair.

238
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,464
Well, that's <i>Dallas.</i>

239
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,200
<i>Dallas</i> indeed.

240
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,901
What? Ryan, where did
you get this picture?

241
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,474
My mom also
makes the best salsa.

242
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,281
This is your mom's
old stuff?

243
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,748
Yeah, mostly.

244
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,741
How's she doing?

245
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,215
It didn't go down easy,
but she's made some friends

246
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,950
and it's already
better than it was.

247
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,422
How do you know
when it's time?

248
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,290
I don't know
if you ever know.

249
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,819
And if you wait for
the day when your parent
comes to you and says,

250
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,663
"I can't take care of myself,"
that's never going to happen.

251
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,334
I have a box of
bras under the table
if you're interested.

252
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,267
Let me see.

253
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:52,409
Okay, I think animals
and proposals are out.
Right, Ryan?

254
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,447
Didn't you read in
one of your blogs
that animals...

255
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,211
Blogs are out,
but people are texting
each other, "No more animals."

256
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,611
How about this?

257
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,621
I throw a corpse
dressed like me
off of the roof.

258
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,479
It hits the ground...
Yep.

259
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,922
...the head pops off.

260
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,220
This leads to me
saying the line,

261
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,421
"I lost my head when I
fell in love with you."

262
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,622
That's a guarantee.

263
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,097
Easy enough
to get a corpse.

264
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,895
You just go to a med school.
I already have the ring.

265
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,431
Don't think you
need the corpse then.

266
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,330
There's the ring.

267
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,669
Holy... Is that real?

268
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,763
Yeah.

269
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,135
They say three-year salary.

270
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,702
Is she not going
to like that?

271
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,245
No, she's going to love it,

272
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,148
so I think you can
keep the proposal simple.

273
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,383
You know,
like when Jim proposed.

274
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,113
He just...
He got down on one knee

275
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,779
and he told me
that he loved me

276
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,220
and he asked me
to marry him,
and it was perfect.

277
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,158
Where was that?

278
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,853
At a gas station.

279
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,085
At a gas station?

280
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,694
Well, it was when
she was working
in New York,

281
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,164
so it was halfway
between both of us.

282
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,532
That must have
been a surprise

283
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,833
when at the gas
station you proposed.

284
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:56,133
No, it was really...
It was really sweet.
It was raining and...

285
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,707
Yeah, you didn't say
that the weather was bad.

286
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,804
That sounds perfect.

287
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:08,379
I want this to be an event
that everyone talks about
always and forever.

288
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:09,912
Totally reasonable.

289
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,714
I just... It's terrifying.

290
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,652
She's not going to say no.

291
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,056
I know, but I'm still scared.
I don't know why.

292
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,060
Because it's a big deal.

293
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,329
I mean, I knew Pam
was going to say yes,
but I was still scared.

294
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:22,961
You were scared?

295
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,368
Yeah, it's scary.

296
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:32,170
Get this.
Kevin thought I was going
to sell my Bowflex for $200.

297
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,545
And I told him,
"Dude, this was
a prop in my movie."

298
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,411
Look, I need to talk to you.

299
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,650
Okay. It's because we
haven't sold anything.

300
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,415
You know what?
You just wait until
the end of the day,

301
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,547
people will get desperate
and they're going
to pay anything.

302
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,788
I think I need to
go home to Colorado.

303
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,820
My dad isn't doing so well.

304
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
Oh!

305
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,226
Okay. For how long?

306
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,027
I don't know.

307
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,767
Is he all right?
Yeah.

308
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,826
Are you okay?

309
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:58,928
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just, you know...

310
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,769
I just don't want to
go home when he's
on his death bed.

311
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,672
You know, I want to
be there when
he's still my dad.

312
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,439
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you
definitely need to do that.

313
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,642
And I want you
to come with me.

314
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,578
I know that's a lot
to ask of a boyfriend.

315
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,511
Okay.

316
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,886
And I was thinking,
you know, maybe,

317
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,085
since given our
last conversation

318
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,527
and that we're both ready...

319
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,496
Michael Scott, will you...

320
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,831
No, no. Shut it.

321
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,105
Oh, God,
nope, nope, nope.

322
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,736
What?

323
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:41,508
No, I am not going
to be proposed to
in the break room.

324
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,880
That is not going
to be our story.

325
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,940
Mmm-mmm.

326
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,614
Should have
burned this place down
when I had a chance.

327
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,516
Hey, guys, it's my turn.

328
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,925
You can't go. You're dead.
I shot you five moves ago.

329
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,326
Yeah, I told you,
you can't shoot people.

330
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,229
I told you we're
way past rules.

331
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,062
We have been
for some time now.

332
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,002
I start having rules now,
everything we've
built collapses.

333
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,131
Well, this is stupid,
and I want my money back.

334
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,234
Where's the money?

335
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,608
Yeah, where is it?

336
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,113
Okay. You know what?
I am never,

337
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,447
ever playing games
with you two again.

338
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,455
And that is <i>Dallas.</i>

339
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:30,922
RYAN: Nice.
JIM: Not bad, right?

340
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,156
RYAN: I can't really tell,
but...

341
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,358
Nice.

342
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,526
I know, right?

343
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,702
What the...

344
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,136
Oh, my God.

345
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,369
That's impossible.
It is, right?

346
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,570
I mean, it's impossible.

347
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,208
All right. I'll take them.

348
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,911
They're probably worthless.
Probably.

349
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,115
Leave the telescope.

350
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,223
DWIGHT: <i>I started with</i>
<i>a thumb tack</i>

351
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,251
and traded my way
to a telescope.

352
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,925
But in a way
the most valuable thing here

353
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,023
wasn't the telescope
at all. No.

354
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,632
It was this
packet of beans.

355
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,070
So I traded
the telescope for it,

356
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,132
and I can just go
buy another telescope.

357
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,308
Hey. How'd we do?

358
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,377
Thirteen dollars.
That's great.

359
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,681
And still have most
of our stuff? Good.

360
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,010
Listen, about earlier...

361
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,919
No, no, no, no, no.
Let's not talk about that.

362
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,925
It was wrong to put you
in that position. I...

363
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,086
Michael, you're my life now.

364
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,356
I'm not going to Colorado.

365
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,999
You know what?
Let's go for a little walk.

366
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,365
I want to show you
some stuff.

367
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,341
So this is one of
my favorite places
in the world.

368
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,344
Why?
This is where
Toby announced

369
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,778
that he was
going to Costa Rica.

370
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,941
It was the happiest
day of my life

371
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,985
until the day you
came to replace him.

372
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,516
Let's go in here.

373
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,254
And this is where
we first kissed.

374
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,591
I remember.

375
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,495
And this is where
we first made love.

376
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,692
Oh, yeah.

377
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,234
Remember what
I tried there?

378
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,701
Michael.

379
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,869
Through these blinds
is where I first saw you,

380
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,570
and you had
all these boxes

381
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,840
and I thought you
were the prettiest
mover I'd ever seen.

382
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,942
And I was sitting
at this desk

383
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,715
when I called you to
tell you that I had herpes

384
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,380
and that I was
still in love with you,

385
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,624
and you said that it
was over and that you
didn't love me.

386
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,992
But thank goodness
none of that was true,

387
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,190
including the herpes.
Ingrown hair.
Yes.

388
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:50,463
Right in here,
this is where we
co-ran our first meeting.

389
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,235
You remember?
Obesity awareness.

390
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,330
Mmm-hmm.

391
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,636
Saved a lot of
lives that day.

392
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,074
That's when you
first met Michael Klump.

393
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,144
"I say, I say,
I'll sit on you."

394
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,510
And right over there,
that's where you realized

395
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,915
that Meredith was
prostituting herself
for Outback steak.

396
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,550
And I will never forget
that you had the cutest
look on your face

397
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,611
because you
couldn't believe it.

398
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,817
You thought
it was so wrong.

399
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,618
And over here...

400
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:14,786
What happened here?

401
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,489
Well, nothing.
Nothing, really.

402
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,499
I would just find
an excuse to come here

403
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,432
so I could stare at
you through that window.

404
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,659
This is what I'd do.

405
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,966
Nice.

406
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,704
Let's go in here.
Okay.

407
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,151
Hi, guys.

408
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,251
This is where our love
faces its toughest test.

409
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,316
After this,
it's just smooth sailing
for the rest of our lives.

410
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,821
Holly, will you marry me?

411
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,163
No.

412
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,223
Marry me, Holly.

413
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,290
No.

414
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,633
That guy's got more than he
can handle as it is.

415
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,535
Will you marry me?
No.

416
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,463
That marriage
would be a sham.

417
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,031
Will you marry me?
No.

418
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,133
Easy "no."

419
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,711
Will you marry me?
No.

420
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,371
That would be hot.
I would pay to see that.

421
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,675
Will you marry me, Holly?

422
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:09,772
No.

423
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,080
Only one that I was
kind of worried about.

424
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,610
This is where I
fell in love with you.

425
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,713
And this is where I
ask you to marry me.

426
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,655
It started with...

427
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:13,946
Holly Flax, marrying me,
will you be?

428
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,708
Your wife becoming,
be will I.

429
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,036
That was so awesome.

430
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,230
Congratulations!

431
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,363
Congratulations!

432
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,169
Thank you. So guys,
guys, guys, guys,

433
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,073
we're moving to Colorado.

434
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,443
All of us?
Yep.

435
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,669
Wait, what?

436
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,909
Holly has to go
back to Colorado.

437
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,042
I'm going with her.
I'm leaving.
