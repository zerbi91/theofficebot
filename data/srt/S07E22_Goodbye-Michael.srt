1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:07,564
Well, I'm moving to Colorado
to start my new life
with Holly.

2
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,509
Just up here getting
used to the altitude.

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:11,738
Michael?
Yes?

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:12,939
I've got
a treat for you.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,207
Oh!

6
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,544
Thank you.
Like a butler.

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,778
Colorado specialty,
Rocky Mountain oysters.

8
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,320
Wow, those do not
taste like oysters.

9
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,257
That's because
they're not oysters.
They're bull testicles!

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,089
I cut them off
fresh this morning!

11
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,621
Sick freak.
What is wrong with you?

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,689
What is wrong with you?
I'm the sick freak?
Yeah.

13
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,962
After what you did,
you expect to be buttled?

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,765
After you didn't
recommend me?

15
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,668
Dwight, I don't own
Dunder Mifflin, okay?

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,366
The job was not
mine to give.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,014
Look, I need your
advice on something.

18
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:55,146
I am told that there
are bears in the Rockies.

19
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,349
Where did you hear that?

20
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,925
Obvious, XM radio?

21
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,392
Well, I was just thinking

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,295
that maybe I should keep
a salami in my pocket...

23
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,423
Great idea.

24
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,659
...in order to feed
the bears.

25
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,602
Especially if you think
that life would be
better without legs!

26
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,104
How do you mean?

27
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,801
Black bears can smell a salami
at five miles, Michael.

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,036
What are you thinking?

29
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,839
And they run
faster than a horse.

30
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,641
So if you were thinking about
outrunning them on a horse,

31
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,806
I would try a cheetah.

32
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,909
You in tight pants, Michael,
are a salami to a black bear.

33
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,579
Do you understand?
Mmm-hmm.

34
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,713
You're like
a giant walking salami.

35
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,453
Okay,
so no salami in the pants.

36
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,619
How about a pepperoni?

37
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,755
Any kind of meat
you can possibly name.
Okay.

38
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,259
You're not gonna take
all your toys, are you?

39
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,563
Hmm?

40
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,165
I mean, you don't...
You don't have
a job lined up, so...

41
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,268
It's not like you have
a desk to put them on.

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,774
Well, I have interviews.

43
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,208
That's nice.

44
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,972
What about that truck?

45
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,241
Can I have
this little truck?

46
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,509
Was thinking I might
glue a stapler on top

47
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,246
or put a hole here
and stick pens in it.

48
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,121
You okay?
Yes.

49
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,022
Yes, you know what,

50
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,254
take my favorite
truck, sure.

51
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,120
You know what...

52
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,427
It's your last
couple of days.

53
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,297
I'm gonna get
out of your hair.

54
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,630
Oh, you don't...

55
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,067
I will be in
the break room.

56
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,538
Okay, that sounds good.
Thank you.

57
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,677
Dead man walking.

58
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,680
Sad?

59
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,805
No.

60
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,974
No, no.

61
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,747
I don't leave till tomorrow,
so tomorrow I will be a wreck.

62
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,494
Stay away from Erin.
Hey.

63
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,723
I'm your boss.

64
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,629
Why don't you
stay away from me?

65
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,597
No, I'm gonna stand
where I want, okay?

66
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,033
You don't want to
get on my bad side.

67
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,569
I've seen some
horrible things.

68
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,162
I own over
200 horror movies.

69
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,864
Okay, that's so weird!

70
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,999
Just go away!

71
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,234
No, you go away.

72
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,784
Hi, Tuna.

73
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,691
You guys are filming people
when they go to
the bathroom now?

74
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,259
How about cupcakes?

75
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,725
Please.

76
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,524
What's wrong
with cupcakes?
Everything.

77
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,791
There they are.

78
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,265
The Party Planning Committee
together again.

79
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,368
Well, we all wanted
to plan your goodbye party.

80
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,427
We thought this
would be easier.

81
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,733
We thought.

82
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,137
It's an experiment.

83
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,676
The three of us
have all been
chairmen before.

84
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,371
So this is
the dream team.

85
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,673
Hey!

86
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,543
What are you saying?

87
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,243
The dream team
and Meredith.

88
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,583
We decided on the ice cream.
Mint chocolate chip.
Your favorite.

89
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,677
Mmm.

90
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,051
Yeah, that was a surprise.
MICHAEL: You know what?

91
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,753
I'm thinking maybe
we should get ice cream
that everybody will like.

92
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,818
How about vanilla?
Let's get vanilla.

93
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,892
Okay.

94
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,365
Tomorrow, I want everybody
to have a good time.

95
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,960
No drama.

96
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,336
And as for today,
just a typical day.

97
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,770
All right?

98
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,736
PAM: Should we
get toppings?

99
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,134
What do you like, Pam?

100
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,366
What?

101
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,969
What kind of
topping would you like?

102
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:40,937
Hot fudge?

103
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,842
Sounds good.

104
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,775
Fudge it up.

105
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,856
I bought this for myself.

106
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,585
And yesterday,

107
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,854
they gave me this.

108
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,535
I still need something
to drink out of, though.

109
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,980
Attention, everyone.

110
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,251
Before I leave tomorrow,
I would like to
reveal a secret

111
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,816
that I have kept
for over 20 years.

112
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,020
Secret about Phyllis.

113
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,763
Please, Michael.

114
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,663
When Phyllis was
in high school,

115
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,362
she was so cute.

116
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,202
And she still is.

117
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:44,037
I thought he knew
about the baby I gave away.

118
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,774
Look, Michael,
it's a going-away present
so your hands won't get cold.

119
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,838
Ah.

120
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,110
It's almost done,
but you can't get them wet,

121
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,778
and they can't be
dry-cleaned either.

122
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,790
You have to hand
wash without water,

123
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,123
wring dry gently,
and use a hair dryer on cool.

124
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,590
Sounds great.
I just think it's great.

125
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,758
Oh, I have gifts as well.

126
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:12,237
And I will start by giving
the first gift to Phyllis.

127
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,168
Phyllis,
you are shy and sweet,

128
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,973
and you don't
often speak your mind,

129
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,446
but you should,
because you have
great ideas.

130
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,015
So, Phyllis,
I am giving you this

131
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,019
so you can always remember
to speak your mind.

132
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,179
Gee, thanks, Michael.

133
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,688
You're welcome.
It's cute.

134
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,554
Stanley, you love your Sudoku
and your puzzles.

135
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,894
I bestow upon you...

136
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,887
My felt.

137
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,992
May you never lose
the fun-loving
quality in life.

138
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,964
Where's the rest of it?
It's got no balls.

139
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,504
Well, okay.

140
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,371
And Andy.

141
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,401
Andy, who needs confidence
that he is a great salesman,

142
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,141
I give you

143
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,473
my clients.

144
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,614
Our ten most
important accounts.

145
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,155
Wow.
Yeah, wow.

146
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,586
You know I'm the worst
salesman here, right?

147
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,218
But you're the best
salesman on the inside.

148
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,455
What does that even mean?

149
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,564
You sold us all on Andy.

150
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,792
A product that nobody wanted.

151
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,298
I'm gonna lose them.

152
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,357
You're not going to
lose them.

153
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,596
I promise you
that I will.

154
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,168
Just do your best.

155
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,002
I have faith in you.

156
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,711
Gimme those clients.
No.

157
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,907
Do you believe that?

158
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,044
I've given up
expecting Michael
to do the right thing

159
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,985
or the decent thing or even
the comprehensible thing.

160
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,217
DEANGELO: <i>I used to</i>
<i>be obese.</i>

161
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,748
<i>Once you've conquered obesity,</i>
<i>everything else is easy.</i>

162
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,024
<i>Life literally</i>
<i>moves in slow motion.</i>

163
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,258
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>I'm Superman,</i>

164
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,124
<i>but let me just</i>
<i>put it this way,</i>

165
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,965
<i>if I were shot</i>
<i>in the head,</i>

166
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,335
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>everything would be fine.</i>

167
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,337
I almost welcome it.

168
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,943
Kevin, I have
something for you.

169
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,473
Oh!

170
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,114
You know who that is?

171
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,343
Oh.

172
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,083
Don't be a caricature, Kevin.
Never be a caricature.

173
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,730
How did that feel
when I tore that up?

174
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,956
Better?
Good.

175
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,224
Stand up.

176
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,964
You will be thin.

177
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,735
You won't drool over pizza
like an animal anymore.

178
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,007
But, I...
You will find love.

179
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,778
Michael, I'm pretty much
okay with who I am now.

180
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,051
Don't be.
You should never
settle for who you are.

181
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,460
Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.

182
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,622
Oscar, you are a...

183
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,997
Michael,
I just lost Porter Hardware!
I just... I lost them.

184
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,731
Okay, you know what?
Just do your best, buddy.

185
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,535
Okay, Oscar,
you are very smart,

186
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,511
and you have
a gigantic education,

187
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,240
and I think of
you as my Scarecrow,
because you gave me a brain.

188
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,853
So that's why
I made you this.

189
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,354
Thank you, Michael.

190
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,255
It's beautiful.

191
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,424
It looks like...

192
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:32,262
It looks like it was made
by a two-year-old monkey
on a farm.

193
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,935
And he just...

194
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,174
He just accepted it,
that I...

195
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,945
That I put all
this work into it.

196
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,383
Oh, man.

197
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,850
He has the lowest
opinion of me of anybody.

198
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,282
Was it just me,

199
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,850
or did you think
we were gonna have sex
at some point?

200
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,191
It was just you.

201
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,525
How would you
have wanted to do it?

202
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,691
I don't...
Okay, you know what?
Inappropriate,

203
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,463
because I am engaged happily,

204
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,835
and you, you have
landed yourself a senator.

205
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,998
State senator.

206
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,267
Mmm-hmm. Bravo.

207
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,707
Brava.
Brava.

208
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:10,902
Do you want to
see some pictures?

209
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,910
I just got these.
Sure.

210
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,282
These are... Okay,
this is us at the theater.

211
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,952
And, antiquing.

212
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,120
Oh, rollerblading.
Rollerblading.

213
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,385
Who's that?
Who's that guy?

214
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,053
Oh, that's Thomas,
Robert's aide.
Hmm.

215
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,828
I guess this
could be the one, huh?

216
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,160
Yeah.

217
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,700
Yeah.

218
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,433
Hey.
Hey.

219
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:48,844
I'm gonna be dropping in
on one of our biggest
clients this afternoon,

220
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,008
and I could use
some backup.

221
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,319
Let's rip it up, homes.
All right.

222
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,221
Boom.

223
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,761
Walk away, bitch.

224
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,794
Oh, Michael.
Hmm?

225
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,991
Where do you want
your last paycheck sent?

226
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,724
Last paycheck?

227
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,298
Do you have
an address yet
in Colorado?

228
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,096
No.

229
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,142
What town do
Holly's parents live in?

230
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,445
I'm not sure.

231
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,841
Mountainton, I think.

232
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,244
Sounds beautiful.

233
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,148
PAM: You should do
more stuff like that.

234
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,450
KEVIN: I'm going to.

235
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,316
Hey.
It's almost your last day.
Come on. Sit with us.

236
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,622
No, I'm almost done.

237
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,322
You sure?
Yeah.

238
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,799
PAM: So I'm going to
Carbondale this afternoon
to get a new bulk shredder.

239
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,337
KEVIN: Finally.
That old shredder sucked.

240
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,464
It's a good shredder.
It just keeps breaking.

241
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,701
Yeah, and it won't
shred magazines.

242
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,437
It's not supposed to
shred magazines, Kevin.

243
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,135
I know.

244
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,710
Did you break
the shredder, Kevin?

245
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:58,081
No. It's just that
old shredder sucks.

246
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,916
Just get one
that'll shred magazines.

247
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,752
PAM: I don't think
any of them are supposed
to shred magazines.

248
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,056
I can't...

249
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,123
I can't do this.

250
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,028
All the channels are
gonna be different there.

251
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,396
I'm not gonna be
able to find my shows.

252
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,301
I'm not going to
start improv at level one.

253
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,896
I don't think my credits
are gonna transfer.

254
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,074
Oh! And you know what?

255
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,578
I just figured out
where I was supposed to
go to vote.

256
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,143
I gotta call her.

257
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,345
And I'm going to tell
her that I cannot come.

258
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,683
üPHONE RINGING
ON SPEAKERPHONEä

259
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:38,947
HOLLY: <i>Hello there.</i>

260
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,082
Hi.

261
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,353
What is the name
of our town?

262
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,829
<i>Boulder.</i>

263
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,889
<i>Is something wrong?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

264
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,996
No. No, I just needed
to hear your voice.

265
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,662


266
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,333
Yeah.

267
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,137
Yes, my hero.

268
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,270


269
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:07,019
<i>Okay, my mom's looking</i>
<i>at me like she has</i>
<i>no sense of humor.</i>

270
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,486
<i>It's a joke.</i>

271
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,823
Oh, I miss you.

272
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,358
<i>Well, I'll see you</i>
<i>tonight.</i>

273
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,485
<i>I'll pick you up</i>
<i>outside baggage claim.</i>

274
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,359
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

275
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,663
I love you.
<i>I love you, too.</i>

276
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,834
Yeah,
so I know I told everybody
that tomorrow is my last day,

277
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,673
but I'm gonna be
leaving tonight.

278
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,177
I head to the airport
at 4:00.

279
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,487
And, I have said goodbye
to half of them.

280
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:51,088
Well, you know, Michael,
I have a brother in Boulder.

281
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,156
Rory Flenderson.

282
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,133
You should look him up.

283
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,372
Okay.

284
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,537
Okay?

285
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,280
Kelly?

286
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,847
Kelly?

287
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,221
Kelly?
What?

288
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,726
If I just went away
right now,

289
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,423
would that be the best gift
that I could give you?

290
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,828
Yes, please.

291
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,924
Please go away
and stop using that weird,
slow voice.

292
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,365
She was once my girl,
and she is your girl now.

293
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,766
Wow.
Yeah.

294
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,312
This is
totally unnecessary.

295
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,606
You're not prone
to seizures?

296
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,041
No.

297
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,083
So Michael said we can do
whatever we want cake-wise.

298
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,987
What do we want?
Erotic.

299
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,486
See? This is
what happens.

300
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,354
You can't let
a street dog
into the house.

301
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,654
Hmm. Let's hear her out.

302
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,457
I would like to hear
more about these cakes.

303
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,361
I know these Ethiopians
that run a cake shop.

304
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,367
Good God.
They make these
cakes that are wild.

305
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,802
I mean...
They show everything.

306
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,198


307
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,968
No, I know
what you're thinking,
but it's not just black.

308
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,269
They do it all.

309
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,038
And the women
on these cakes,

310
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,703
they're not just
guys' fantasies.

311
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,112
They have real,
full women.

312
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,642
It is refreshing.

313
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,276
Okay, don't turn this
into some feminist issue.

314
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,844
As a person who buys
a lot of erotic cakes,

315
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,618
it just feels good to
be represented on one.

316
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,923
You know what?
I think we should
get some other input.

317
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,053
I think we should
do cupcakes.

318
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,894
I am one of the few people
who looks hot
eating a cupcake.

319
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,797
Yeah, cupcakes,
that's what I said.

320
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,269
No. I am not
cleaning up a bunch of
uneaten cupcake bottoms.

321
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,828
You know, we don't really
care about your opinion.

322
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,431
You're just a tie-breaker.

323
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,101
Um, Pam?

324
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,440
Oh, hey, Michael.

325
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,412
I'm just gonna
go to Carbondale
to price some shredders.

326
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,006
I'll see you later.
Okay.

327
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,860
ERIN: Gabe!
I need to talk to you.

328
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,633
You can't be in here.
This is a ladies' bathroom.

329
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,139
No, Erin,
I respect your privacy,

330
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,607
but I will
follow you in here

331
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,974
every time you go if
that's what it takes.

332
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,410
Hey, Creed.

333
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,970
Not cool, man.

334
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,043
I really think
you should leave.

335
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,381
Someday, you are going
to tell our grandchildren

336
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,978
about how their grandfather
won you back in
a women's room.

337
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,081
Gabe, can we talk
about this later?
I have to go. I have to go.

338
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,285
Just read
the letter under your
windshield wiper, okay?

339
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,418
It explains everything.

340
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,723
Okay.
Okay?

341
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,263
Do you want...
Gabe!

342
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,423
Well.

343
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,360
Here's the thing, Rory.

344
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,528
I think you guys would
hit it off in an odd way.

345
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,898
<i>I could bring him</i>
<i>a welcome basket.</i>
<i>I'll surprise him.</i>

346
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,601
Okay, well,
you should give him

347
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,302
a little time to
settle in, but...

348
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,038
<i>Does he like jams?</i>
<i>My shelves are</i>
<i>overflowing with preserves.</i>

349
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,478
Well, no, he hates jams.

350
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,484
Darryl.
Hey.

351
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,921
I would like to
give you the only copy
of <i>Somehow I Manage,</i>

352
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,355
unfinished.

353
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,018
If there's anybody here
who can finish it,
it's you.

354
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,128
That's sweet, Mike.

355
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,721
Let's see here.

356
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,068
Here's a chapter
called "Gum."
Mmm.

357
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,797
With one sentence.

358
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,768
"Everybody likes the guy
who offers them
a stick of gum."

359
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,274
Mmm-hmm. It's true.

360
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,371
Darryl, I have
one last wish.

361
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,640
I would like
to use the baler.

362
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,444
No. Can't let you
do that, Mike.

363
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,643
No problem.
Sorry.

364
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,844
Worth a try.
All right.

365
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,150
Darryl said I could use
the baler because I'm leaving.

366
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,587
No.

367
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,989
All right, guys, well,

368
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,761
see ya later, warehouse.

369
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,365
Catch you on
the flippety-flip.

370
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,103
All right then,
see you, guys.

371
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,744
Catch you later,
warehouse.

372
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,007
See you on
the flippety-flip.

373
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,877
Catch you on
the flippety-flip.

374
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,655
Catch you guys
on the flippety-flip.

375
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,383
Come on.

376
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,121
Okay.
So what's our approach?

377
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,595
You a veteran?
Do I have a month to live?

378
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,258
You gonna get
married tomorrow? What?

379
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,095
Hmm?

380
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,603
I thought we'd
just talk about
our customer service

381
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,232
and exceptional
paper quality.

382
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,032
That's stupid.

383
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,471
Well, what do I know?

384
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,444
I know.
What do you know?

385
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,039
We gotta get psyched up.
Okay, guy?

386
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,046
Let's get psyched.

387
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,747
Is there an animal
shelter on the way?

388
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,121
Yeah.
Awesome!

389
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,716
Ani-ani-shelto.

390
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,454


391
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,393
Andy, do you know
how to high-five?

392
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,895
Yeah.

393
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,125
'Cause if you do,
now's the time.

394
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,460
All right.

395
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,229
Not while I'm driving.

396
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,438
Catch you guys...

397
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,538
Catch you guys on
the flippety-flip.

398
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,402
Flippety-flip.

399
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,378
Flippety-flip.

400
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,915
Really?

401
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,653
Okay, see you guys.

402
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:29,401
You know how I met Jo Bennett
and got started on
my ladder of success?

403
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,663
No, I don't.

404
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,166
Walking along,
out of work, again,

405
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,176
thinking to myself,

406
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:41,806
"I've only got
enough cash to buy
a sandwich or get drunk."

407
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,977
And I see this guy
trying to steal
this lady's dog.

408
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,681
So I grab the dog,
he runs off.

409
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,087
She's so grateful,
she hires me.

410
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,354
Aw, wow.

411
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,358
Gimme that dog!

412
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,088
It's not your dog!

413
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,687
Yeah.

414
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,993
Again.
Oh, okay.

415
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,530
Gimme that damn dog,
you...thief!

416
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,569
It's her dog!
Okay.

417
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,733
Don't ever do it again!

418
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,637


419
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,437
You feel that energy?

420
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,772
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?

421
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,012
Whoo! Yeah.

422
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,747
Okay, again.

423
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,289
I know that Gabe is young
and hot and everything,

424
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,791
and he's begging me
to reconsider,

425
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,759
but I just think I'm in love
with someone else.

426
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,193
Kevin?
Andy.

427
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,489
Ah.

428
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,058
I wish I knew who
my birth mother was

429
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,967
so she could just
tell me who to choose.

430
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,230
Maybe neither.

431
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,608
I'm not attracted
to Kevin.

432
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,837
Erin, listen to me.

433
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,005
You shouldn't rush
into this at all.
And you know why?

434
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,743
Because you are beautiful,
and you are fun,

435
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,148
and you are smart.

436
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,516
And when
the right guy comes along,
you'll know it.

437
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:58,916
You will.

438
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,789
Hey.

439
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,861
And you know what?

440
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,262
You don't need a mom,

441
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,858
because you have my number
and you can call me anytime.

442
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,630
Extension 147.

443
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,096


444
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,105
Okay. Okay.

445
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,715
Did you want
the 2726 or the 2730?

446
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,219
Phyllis? Phyllis,
are my mittens done?

447
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,255
No. No.
I'm on a sale...

448
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,449
Okay, listen,
it's 2:00 p.m.

449
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,084
From now until 4:00,
your priority is knitting.

450
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,184
Knit like the wind.

451
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,351
Okay, Michael.

452
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,227
Dwight, I will
be leaving tomorrow.

453
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,132
Yes?
So I wanted
to give you that.

454
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,568
It's a letter of
recommendation.

455
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,973
This is gonna be good.

456
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,738
"To whom it may concern."

457
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,614
Good, real personal.
Thanks, Michael.

458
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,078
"The dictionary
defines 'superlative'

459
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,021
"as 'of the highest kind,
quality, or order,

460
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,024
"'surpassing all else
or others. Supreme.'"

461
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,185
That's great.

462
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,162
If I wanted
the dictionary definition,
I'd buy a dictionary.

463
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,132
"I define it as
Dwight Schrute.

464
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,205
"As a sales executive,
as a leader, as a man,
and as a friend,

465
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:26,478
"he is of
the highest kind, quality,
and order. Supreme."

466
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,486
Lots more like that.
Really repetitive.

467
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,984
What's this?

468
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,390
"2:45 behind the building,
paintball."

469
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,924
Oh!

470
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,193
Come on, come on!
Come on!

471
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,762
Ow!

472
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:42,844
I would like to
start by just saying
that I have not worked with

473
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,790
Mr. Andy Bernard
here for very long.

474
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:48,987
But I can say that
he is no Michael Scott.

475
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,626
I can't sit here
and tell you that he's
gonna be a success.

476
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,364
I can't sit here
and tell you that he's even
the best man for the job.

477
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,496
But I can say this.

478
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,800
He's got potential.

479
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,803
Sure.

480
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,973
You know, I always say,
"Go big or go home."

481
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,906
You go with this guy,

482
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,506
you could be making
the biggest mistake
of your life.

483
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,980
Or the biggest good
decision of your life.

484
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,881
It's either gonna be
the best thing you ever did,

485
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,185
or the worst thing
you ever did.

486
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,654
If you want some boring,
white bread clock-watcher,

487
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,320
who's gonna
get you your paper

488
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,389
when you ordered it
for the agreed-upon price,

489
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,564
Andy's not your guy.

490
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,071
You ever play
Russian roulette?

491
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,107
Time to spin the chamber,
Boris...

492
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,445
By signing up
for another year.

493
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,774
What happened to you?

494
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,144
You should see
the other guy.

495
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,354
Jim, where is Pam?

496
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,227
She's still pricing
the whatevers...
The shredders.

497
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,164
But it is already 3:00.

498
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,066
Right.

499
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,181
Whether you're
scared of dying,
or dying alone,

500
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,748
or dying drunk in a ditch,

501
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,088
don't be.

502
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,421
It's going to be okay.

503
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,924
MICHAEL: <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I was tripling up.</i>

504
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,227
There's not enough
time in the day

505
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,596
to have a special
moment with everybody.

506
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,465
And you,
why are you still here?

507
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,637
I'm either
gonna quit today

508
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,870
or stay to make sure
that Andy's career
is destroyed.

509
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,469
No, you are not
going to quit today.

510
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,707
For goodness sake,

511
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,012
this is not going to be
your last day at the office.

512
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,845
Everybody
gets dumped, Gabe.

513
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:55,948
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

514
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,048
A little cover-up
on your Adam's apple
will make it appear smaller,

515
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,789
which will make you
look less like
a transvestite.

516
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,841
That is cold, sir.

517
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:17,933
Absolutely cold.
You know what?

518
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,774
It was a complete
waste of my time.

519
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,410
Uh, Deangelo, I'm...

520
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,587
I forgot my bag,
so I'm gonna...

521
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,146
I'll meet you in the car.
Okay, whatever.

522
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,649
Sir.

523
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,253
I'd just like to
apologize for that.

524
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,365
I could tell you that he has
a steel plate in his head,

525
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,161
or that he's crazy,

526
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:44,761
but the truth is,
I think he's just
a terrible salesman.

527
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,101
And I want you to know
that if you re-up with us,

528
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,303
anything you need,
day or night,

529
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,276
I will be the one
to take your call.

530
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,010
Keep talking.

531
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:00,977
Yes.

532
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,313
Okay. All right.

533
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,089
No. Well, thank you.

534
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,490
Thank you.
All right. Take care.

535
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,659
You'll never guess.
We did it.

536
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,161
Hey!

537
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,428
All right.

538
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,059
All right.

539
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,600
Good job, boss. Yeah.
We did it.

540
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,778
Okay, everybody, come on.

541
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,476
Conference room,
five seconds! Here we go!

542
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,585
Hurry up! Let's do this!

543
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,720
Yes. What is this about?

544
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,419
What is this meeting about?
All right.
STANLEY: Mmm-hmm.

545
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,123
Well...

546
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,457
Okay. Here we are in
the conference room.

547
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,929
Once again.

548
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:53,564
And I just wanted to
call you all here together

549
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,402
because I have
something important...

550
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:58,967
Well, there's
two things, actually.

551
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,242
Okay, first, I would like
a whereabouts on Pam,

552
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:06,575
and, secondly, Phyllis,
how are those mittens coming?

553
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,850
Because I would actually
like to bring them home
and pack them,

554
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,515
and I am leaving
for the day at 4:00.

555
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,683
They're almost done,

556
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,284
but my knuckles are
swelling a little,
and I can't...

557
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,352
Well, power through
the arthritis, Phyllis.
You can do it.

558
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,464
Is that it?

559
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,666
Um, hmm?

560
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,402
STANLEY: Is that it?

561
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:34,004
Um... Hmm.

562
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,976
No.

563
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,479
No.

564
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,284
There's a special guest
that I would like to invite

565
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,483
to say one last goodbye,
so here he comes.

566
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,685
He's coming right in.

567
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,658


568
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,322
It's Ping!

569
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:56,161
And I'm here to say goodbye
to all you wonderful people.

570
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,736
Thank you, everybody!

571
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,030
You've been so wonderful.

572
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,402
We were such a good...
Mmm-mmm.

573
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,010
I "rove" you all.

574
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,306
I "rove" you very much.

575
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,241
Hey, can I talk to
you for a second?
Sure.

576
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,871
See you later!

577
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,243
So I've been
meaning to tell you.

578
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,444
I want to take
you out for lunch.

579
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,953
For your last day.

580
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,113
Oh.

581
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,191
What do you think?
Tomorrow? Lunch?
You and me?

582
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,417
Okay.

583
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,159
You're not leaving tomorrow.

584
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,058
You're leaving today, right?

585
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,832
Maybe.

586
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,637
Wow, so that's it, huh?

587
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:35,364
Just 4:00 and you
are gone for good.

588
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,576
Why am I so sad?

589
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,377
Am I doing
the wrong thing?

590
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,904
Absolutely not.

591
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,875
It's just that sometimes
goodbyes are a bitch.

592
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,688
T-shirt idea.
"Goodbyes stink."

593
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,619
Okay. All right. So...

594
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,360
James Halpert...

595
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,838
You started
with this company

596
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,005
as a fine young man.

597
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,540
You know what I
think we should do?

598
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:18,274
I think we should just save
the goodbyes for tomorrow.

599
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,648
At lunch.

600
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,908
Oh.

601
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,318
Okay.

602
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,787
And then tomorrow

603
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,049
I can tell you

604
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,291
what a great boss
you turned out to be.

605
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,428
Best boss I ever had.

606
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,368
MICHAEL: Oh, shoot.

607
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,735
That's my cab.

608
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,241
All right.
All right.

609
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,706
Listen, Michael,
I really...

610
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,145
I did text Pam, but...

611
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,046
I know. It's okay.

612
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,415
Just give her a hug,
all right?

613
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,755
I will see you
tomorrow at lunch.

614
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,880
I am looking forward
to lunch.

615
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,692
And hearing about
what a great boss I am.

616
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,494
You got it.

617
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,558
Okay.

618
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:11,865
Okay.

619
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,777
Phyllis.

620
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,284
Oh, they're still not done.

621
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,886
Oh, no, no, no.

622
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:30,923
Let me see.
Oh, Phyllis.

623
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:32,957
Nice try.

624
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,459
I love them.

625
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,976
See ya tomorrow, boss.

626
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:02,512
Later, guys.

627
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,102
MICHAEL: <i>Well,</i>
<i>got almost everybody, so...</i>

628
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,475
<i>Holly's my family now.</i>

629
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,141
<i>She's my family.</i>

630
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,978
<i>And the babies</i>
<i>that I make with her</i>
<i>will be my children.</i>

631
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,657
<i>The people that you</i>
<i>work with are just,</i>

632
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,290
<i>when you get down to it,</i>
<i>your very best friends.</i>

633
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,188
<i>They say on your deathbed</i>

634
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,258
<i>you never wish</i>
<i>you spent more time</i>
<i>at the office,</i>

635
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,563
<i>but I will.</i>

636
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,800
<i>Got to be a lot better</i>
<i>than a deathbed.</i>

637
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,974
<i>I actually don't</i>
<i>understand deathbeds.</i>

638
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,205
<i>I mean, who would buy that?</i>

639
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,842
Well, I guess this is it.

640
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,350
Hey, will you guys
let me know
if this ever airs?

641
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,789
Thank you.

642
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,216
All right. Oh.

643
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,822
This is gonna feel so good

644
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,390
getting this thing
off my chest.

645
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,764
That's what she said.

646
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,709
PAM: <i>No, he wasn't sad.</i>

647
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,008
<i>He was full of hope.</i>

648
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,677
About Colorado.

649
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,312
And he was hoping
to get an upgrade
as an awards member.

650
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,326
And he said he was
just real excited
to get home and see Holly.

651
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,608
Well, if he's not
gonna make it,

652
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,617
at least we should go
ahead and eat the cake.

653
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,581
Yeah.

654
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,622
I, for one,
love the corners.

655
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,632
Why did I just do that?

656
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,828
This is not even that good.

657
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,064
I don't even want it.

658
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,871
I had cake for lunch.

659
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,309
No, you know what?
I've been good.
I deserve this.

660
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,374


661
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,582
What am I doing?
Come on, Deangelo.

662
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,915
Hey...

663
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:28,885
No!

664
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,690
Uh-oh.

665
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,625
DEANGELO: No!
