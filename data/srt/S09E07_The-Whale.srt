1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,083
Uh, what else? I've seen
Dirty Dancing like, ten times...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,164
- Breaks my heart every time, you know?
- Whoa!

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,486
Andy!

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,608
That Swayze sure
can dance dirty.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,484
Don't you have
any sunblock?

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,364
No, Walter J's
been hoarding it.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,807
If you want to worry about a part
of my body, worry about my eyes.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,926
They're like two flaming
meatballs in my skull.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,642
Last week, Andy set sail for the
Bahamas to sell his family's boat.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,803
And he took his
brother but not me.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,485
I was kind of sad at first, but then
I remembered that Bob Marley song,

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,281
"No, woman. No cry!"

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,847
Check this out.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,450
Keeps my hair
out of my stare.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,411
Also helps me
combat the Glare Bear.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,811
That's what I
call the sun now.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,446
Andy, it's Darryl. Take
your drawers off your head.

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,570
What else can I show you?
Damn it!

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,760
Oh, Andy, was that
your drinking water?

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,043
Yeah, it was. That's okay, though.
I've got this cool

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,285
desalinator device.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,246
It sucks up sea water through this
hose and pumps out fresh water.

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,527
See? Check it out.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,601
Ow!

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,641
That's not good.

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,690
I'd better sign off.
I need to get going.

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,410
I mean, these Skype sessions
are, like, the only thing

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,323
that keep me sane
out here, you know?

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,044
He's been
sailing for two days.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,845
I'll leave you with this, the
image of a man and his boat!

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,684
Burn this into your brains!

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,010
Yeah.
No.No, No!

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,846
Andy? Andy? Andy? Andy?

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,561
Dwight Schrute.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,649
Well, hi there,
David Wallace.

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,969
Why would you ever call me when
the manager is out of town?

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,088
Well, I have some
very exciting news.

38
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,606
And you didn't call Jim.
That seems significant.

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,882
Hi, David! Jim, good. You
should hear this, too.

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,008
No, he shouldn't!
What? Jim!

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,570
Go ahead, David.
I'm listening.

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,887
I... Okay, David, I want
to take you off speaker.

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,089
But I don't know
where I'd put you.

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,730
Guys, listen.
This is big news.

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,850
The Scranton White Pages just
got in contact with my office.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,890
They have apparently dropped their
supplier for the last ten years.

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,241
The White Pages.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,007
The White Pages.
Do you want it? No.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,241
Do you use it? No.

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,091
Does it inexplicably show up on
your doorstep three times a year?

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,447
Yes, yes and yes.

52
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,522
There is a reason we
in the paper industry

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,642
call this thing
the White Whale.

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,284
Look at all
that sweet blubber.

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,371
Look, we need our
top salesman

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,363
running point on this,
and Dwight, that is you.

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,324
I'm going to need to
put you on hold for a second.

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,769
Yeah! Whoo!

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,885
Eat it, Jim!
Eat it, Phyllis! Eat...

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,524
Where's Stanley?
He's in the bathroom.

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,444
Will you run into the bathroom
and tell him to eat it?

62
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,851
Of course.

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,088
Yeah! Okay.
Hey, David, I'm back.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,281
Eat it, Stanley!

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,566
So, last I remember Tom Peterman
was in charge of that account?

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,483
No, my assistant spoke to the
receptionist over there.

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,528
It's someone new but she
didn't catch her name.

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,801
Her name?

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,168
No. Hey, Dwight shouldn't...

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,643
Thanks, David! Thank you so
much for calling me today.

71
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,290
Good luck!
Good luck to you.

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,801
Dwight, you can't go.

73
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,082
You have a problem with women.
You can't sell to them.

74
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,128
That's a damnable lie.
I love women.

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,601
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,890
said you called her "Jine-a"
for your entire meeting.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,001
NELLIEI EW.

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,401
That's not good.

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,041
Yeah, she said she
corrected him five times.

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,641
"Jine-a" said that?

81
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,724
Guys, we can't let
Dwight blow this!

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,207
An account this size
could double our gross!

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,369
That means raises, bonuses.

84
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,685
Pizza Friday could come back.

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,167
Hey, remember that week in
the '90s when we got bagels?

86
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,765
I miss Clinton.

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,001
Can you go instead?

88
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,048
Can't. I have the thing.

89
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,523
I have this conference call
today with this company

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,880
in Philly
that I'm helping start.

91
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,405
First board meeting.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,207
Also the first time I've ever
been excited about work,

93
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,164
so, that feels

94
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,446
wrong.

95
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,129
Okay, calm down, it's
just me, not Tom Selleck.

96
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,801
Nice.

97
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,850
Toby got us all to
participate in Movember.

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,208
It's a charity
for prostate cancer.

99
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,204
You pledge money and
then you grow a mustache

100
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,520
for the month of November.

101
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,365
So, this is how
we look now.

102
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,524
I hope you like being
turned on all the time.

103
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,805
Damn!

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,405
Just keeps on coming, huh?

105
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,124
I have very
fertile hair glands.

106
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,130
I am so glad I got all of
the dudes to do Movember.

107
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,047
We have the dopest
time back in the annex.

108
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,161
God.

109
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,961
We even go to lunch,
pick up babes.

110
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,244
Smile if you love
men's prostates!

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,323
Hi.
Hi.

112
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,571
Spring cleaning?

113
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,370
More like fall cleaning.

114
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,321
I think the Senator
is having an affair.

115
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,245
This doesn't...

116
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,370
I'm sorry, what?

117
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,325
I think the Senator
is having an affair.

118
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,769
I literally have nightmares in
which what just happened happens.

119
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,771
I wake up in a sweat,

120
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,605
and then I make Angela's
husband spoon me back to bed.

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,690
When he comes home
in the morning,

122
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,290
he has this
secret little smile.

123
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,806
Aww...

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,201
I'm sure that's nothing.

125
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,568
And he's always
at the yoga studio.

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,643
He never misses
the noon class.

127
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,845
Hot Yoga with Blake.

128
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,606
Angela,
Blake is also a guy's name,

129
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,684
so he may be spending his
afternoons with a guy named Blake,

130
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,484
so nothing to worry about.

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,441
Huh.

132
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,322
Blake. Who's Blake?

133
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,401
I don't know.

134
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,841
I've just never heard
about the Senator and yoga.

135
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,321
Right.
From you.

136
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,971
I'm sure it's
probably nothing.

137
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,766
But what's with
the yoga already?

138
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,887
Right?
And Blake?

139
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,644
Right! All right,
Angela, calm down.

140
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,888
We need to go and check this out.
What?

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,490
Angela, I'll go with you.

142
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,769
So, show us how you'd normally
sell to a female client.

143
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,645
Okay, with pleasure.

144
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,081
Time to learn a few
new tricks, old dog.

145
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,446
You got this, Schrute.

146
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,320
You've just walked
into her office and begin.

147
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,320
Hello.
Hello.

148
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,686
May I please
speak to your boss?

149
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,165
No, she is the boss.

150
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,321
I am?
Yes.

151
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,001
Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon,
how can I help you?

152
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,570
Okay, this isn't
working for me,

153
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,484
because no one would ever believe
that she would be a boss.

154
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,324
He's absolutely right,
I'm really struggling here.

155
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,408
I'll be the buyer.

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,681
Okay-

157
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,441
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you.
Please have a seat.

158
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,291
I never sit down
during sales meetings.

159
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,522
I want to appear
aggressive and imposing.

160
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,609
I am going to sell to
you in 12 minutes.

161
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,968
No, actually, she'd like to take
her time discussing her needs.

162
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,885
I will tell her what her needs
are and then fill them.

163
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,010
This is going to
work out best for you

164
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,886
if you just relax
and do nothing.

165
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,686
And once I'm finished,
it's over.

166
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,520
Okay, let's stop here.
Anyone have any thoughts?

167
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,011
I thought it went great.

168
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,282
I have written down
a few questions.

169
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,682
One, have you ever
killed a woman?

170
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,484
How many women
have you killed?

171
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,211
Please sir,
will you not kill me?

172
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,960
Okay,
let's get started.

173
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,565
Okay, cool. Are we all on?

174
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,610
Well, you're the only one
"on." We're all here.

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,926
Right.

176
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,561
Okay, over the next
three months, I...

177
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,847
That's the winter season,
three months.

178
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,961
I had some ideas actually...

179
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,724
Are you at your
office right now?

180
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,482
Yeah. Trust me, I would
rather be with you guys.

181
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,483
Okay. Yeah,
it's sounding kind of

182
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,568
spooky-sexy
over here, Halpert.

183
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,245
Oh.

184
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,402
Sorry. I was
saying that you should probably...

185
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,766
Whoa.

186
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,844
I think there's... I think
there's been a mistake.

187
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,161
We're trying to reach Jim
Halpert, not Batman.

188
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,207
You know what?
I should have just had...

189
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,645
I should have just had you
call me on my cell.

190
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,722
Yeah. I'll... I'm going to
try a different spot. Okay?

191
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,290
Okay, yeah. Okay. I'll
call you right back.

192
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,886
Cool. What's happening
in three months?

193
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,931
Okay, when you're
selling to women,

194
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,445
it is crucial that
you listen, Dwight.

195
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,164
Also, you want to
respect their...

196
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,761
Are you listening now?

197
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,281
Yes.

198
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,369
Okay, well,
you have to show us.

199
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,330
That's impossible. Listening happens
in the ear and in the brain.

200
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,368
I mean, some organisms
have external hairs

201
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,448
that vibrate to
indicate auditory stimulation,

202
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,570
but unfortunately our external
hairs don't vibrate at all.

203
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,802
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,445
What are you doing?

205
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,209
A little smile and a nod shows
that I hear you. Got it?

206
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,481
Kind of.

207
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,926
Nellie,
why don't you tell Dwight

208
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,280
what we were
doing earlier today,

209
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,124
and Dwight, you show us
that you're listening.

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,041
Well, we were in the warehouse
where we were discussing the mural

211
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,088
that I've commissioned
Pam to paint there.

212
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,770
We were talking about
the color schemes

213
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,450
and the major themes
we want to hit.

214
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,086
Children of the world
coming together,

215
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720
cutting down trees
to make paper,

216
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,328
but not in
a child labor-y way.

217
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,849
It's just up and down, just a
regular nod, like a person.

218
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,121
I am a person.

219
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,201
Yes. Yeah.

220
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,169
Of course. You're a person.
We can do this. All right?

221
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,090
And then we thought we'd...

222
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,927
I can't. I just, I can't carry
on with that face. Look at it.

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,604
I'm going to get
nightmares with that face.

224
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,247
I mean, he looks like
he's laboring over

225
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,647
a stool having just
eaten human flesh.

226
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,001
That's a bit extreme.

227
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,241
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but that is true.

228
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,322
He's screwed! The meeting
is in less than an hour.

229
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,968
All right, God, Dwight, just
ignore every instinct you have.

230
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,690
It's all garbage. Okay?

231
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,850
You're the woman,
I'm the salesman.

232
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,968
Watch what I do
and try to learn.

233
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,567
Okay, I'm the woman. I'm a woman. Good?

234
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,841
No.

235
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,767
Ms. Thomas!
So good to see you.

236
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,440
Hello.

237
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,800
Are those your kids?
They're so cute.

238
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,041
They could be models.

239
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,924
Thank you.
I'm so proud of them.

240
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,121
I carried each one of them for
nine months inside of my torso

241
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,009
and then pushed
them out of my vagina.

242
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,208
Boo. Weird.

243
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,001
Okay, well, this is a lost cause.
He's hopeless.

244
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,404
Ten years ago I didn't care if Dwight got
married or died a beet farming bachelor.

245
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,123
But having kids
makes you so soft.

246
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,207
I used to watch Pulp Fiction
and laugh, and now I'm like,

247
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,601
that poor Gimp
is somebody's child.

248
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,608
You know, I think there
could be a lot of benefits

249
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,011
if you could learn to
get along with women.

250
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,930
I have no problem with women.

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,048
It's business women
and their...

252
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,925
Their power suits
and their shoulder pads.

253
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,804
Don't lie about
your shoulders!

254
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,446
Dwight, listen to me.

255
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,930
Business women are just normal,
nice, reasonable people.

256
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,925
Who's a nice, reasonable
person, in your experience?

257
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,205
I had a barber once who used
to comb my hair gently.

258
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,081
Okay. So, when you're
selling to this woman,

259
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,481
just imagine she's that nice,
reasonable barber.

260
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,249
Okay. I can do that.

261
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,765
Good. Baby steps.

262
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,649
He used to fight dogs.

263
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,689
Like, he used to make dogs fight,
or he actually fought dogs?

264
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,525
Little of this,
little of that.

265
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,210
Which one is
the instructor?

266
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,846
They're all fatties.

267
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,683
Angela. Angela.
What? Where?

268
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,607
The stairs,
the stairs.

269
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,767
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

270
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,965
So wait, Blake is a her.

271
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,289
Oh, my God!

272
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,722
She's so stunningly tiny.

273
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,964
She's like a petite double
zero, for sure. For sure.

274
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,280
Holy cow,
look at what they're doing.

275
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,326
She's repositioning his hips
for Downward Facing Dog.

276
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,642
I've heard of this.

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,001
D°9 Style!

278
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,123
Wait! Look, Oscar!

279
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,130
Thumbelina has a boyfriend.

280
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,607
And he has a ponytail. Ew.

281
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,723
I'd like to see
that run for office.

282
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,169
Oscar, you were right, I had
nothing to be worried about.

283
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,284
Thank you.
Let's go, let's go.

284
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,287
Shut up. Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Just, sorry.

285
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,841
Look.

286
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,687
This is fun.
You know?

287
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,010
I mean, this is fun.

288
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,763
What I was saying
is the genius of

289
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,848
Air Jordan was not in
the market saturation,

290
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,564
it was...

291
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,968
It was what?
Sorry...

292
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,530
Jim we're having a lot
of trouble hearing you.

293
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,406
The... What I was saying is, the real
genius was in the...

294
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,082
Hey! Are those
skateboarders back?

295
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,321
Jim? Jim, are you there?

296
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,521
Where are they?

297
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,090
The little punks!

298
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,730
It was in
the authentic design, right?

299
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,767
So, I mean,
you really felt like

300
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,921
Michael Jordan was wearing
these shoes for...

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,287
Jim, who's messing with my van?
Nobody.

302
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,044
Jordan wore them for nobody?

303
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,248
No, no. We're not
following you, Halpert.

304
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,807
This ends now!

305
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,601
Have a seat.
She will be right in.

306
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,206
Great. I'm sorry, do you
mind telling me her name?

307
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,964
I realize we don't have it.

308
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
Uh, she'll be right in.

309
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,765
Okay, great.
She'll...

310
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,921
Okay-

311
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,724
Just a little off the top,
and then a nice combing.

312
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,886
Yeah. Just comb it.

313
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,004
Oh, my God.

314
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,281
It's Jan.

315
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,561
Dear God in heaven.

316
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,804
Jan used to be
one of my superiors,

317
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,843
and she is one of
the most erratic

318
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,928
and terrifying people
I have ever met.

319
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,922
You son of a bitch! You're firing me?
I answered you...

320
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,611
Where the hell do you get off?

321
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,804
Jim and I are pretty sure she had
an affair with her ex-assistant, Hunter.

322
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,921
He was 17.

323
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,607
But she looks great!

324
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,450
If she asks, will you
tell her I said that?

325
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,370
Forget
everything we taught you!

326
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,280
Hey, Jan!
It's so great to see you.

327
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,964
Where's Wallace?
What?

328
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,328
I was under the impression
David Wallace would be coming.

329
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,811
He bought back
Dunder Mifflin, correct?

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,001
Hey!

331
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,482
Your daughter could
be a bubble bath model.

332
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,842
I could just
bite her head off.

333
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,124
Sorry.

334
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,125
David is in Vermont.

335
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,407
Did you speak with him?
He sent Dwight instead.

336
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,641
Molly!

337
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,282
David Wallace
is in Vermont.

338
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,642
Oh, my God.
I talked to his assistant,

339
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,802
and I guess it did
get a little confusing

340
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,769
because you said not
to tell anyone your name.

341
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,645
And then also, these Bluetooths
are very hard to hear with.

342
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,846
I know you love
the way they look,

343
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,126
but Tom never had
us use them, so...

344
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,801
Molly? I am not Tom. lam Jan.

345
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,811
I'm so sorry, Jan.

346
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,285
Anyway-

347
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,243
Thought it would be fun to
have a little chat with

348
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,322
David Wallace
after all these years.

349
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,804
Oh, Well.

350
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,444
What are you doing?
Listening.

351
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,681
- Stop.
- Sorry.

352
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,966
Stop that.
Okay.

353
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,726
So, this was all just a trick? You don't
really have any business to give?

354
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,924
No, I do.

355
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,610
But not to us.

356
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,165
Insightful, Pam.

357
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,288
You did good, Dwight. It's okay.
Seriously, Jan's not normal.

358
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,601
Let's just go. She's not
going to sell to us.

359
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,125
Yes, she is.

360
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,922
Now, I may not have
any instincts with women,

361
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,929
butlhave
an instinct for sales.

362
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,764
You keep her occupied,
I'll be right back.

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,161
What?

364
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,001
Pam.
Yeah?

365
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,445
I'm a very
busy woman, so...

366
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,683
Yeah, do you have any
other pictures of Astrid?

367
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,724
Fine, I will show you
one slideshow.

368
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,446
Erin, did this call come...

369
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,322
Sorry. I just...
I saw your face.

370
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,401
Oh.

371
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,881
I'm sorry.
It's for the thing.

372
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,166
I know. That's great.

373
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,289
It just, it makes it look
like there's an eyebrow

374
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,731
in the middle of your face.

375
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,967
Wow.

376
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,329
A handsome eyebrow! But it makes
your mouth look like an eye socket.

377
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,401
Which isn't bad!

378
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,767
Uh-huh. Butyoulook
like a cyclops

379
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,880
whose eye fell out.

380
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,485
Which is great.
It's such a great cause.

381
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,161
Yeah.

382
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,760
Mommy, you're a princess

383
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,289
Mommy, you're a superstar

384
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,530
Mommy, you're the greatest

385
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,762
How can I ever
fill your shoes?

386
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,211
Your voice is
as lovely as ever.

387
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,281
Oh...

388
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,681
And it is so cute
how she signs her name.

389
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,491
That was... That was me, too.

390
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,327
Okay. It's just, that's how Cece
does it, with the backwards Es.

391
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,840
Cece can't spell her name?

392
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,286
Actually, she can.

393
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,885
Well, it's not really much
of a comparison, is it?

394
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,566
I mean, "Cece" is two
letters, and "Astrid" is...

395
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,520
I mean, there's even some
adults who can't spell it.

396
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,965
Of course.
Can you spell it?

397
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,801
Try to spell it, Pam.

398
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,041
Um...

399
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,281
"A,"

400
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,962
"X"? I don't...
You got me.

401
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,521
Don't patronize me.

402
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,366
I'm so sorry. I hate this.
You're better.

403
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,729
Okay, we should go now.
Let's go.

404
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,407
Wait, just... Just
waitjust a minute. Just watch.

405
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,086
Wait, why are you... Oh. Are you
getting yourjollies right now?

406
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,364
Can't get enough
of the show?

407
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,086
Yourjollies
are all on fire.

408
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,845
Please! It's Robert
who's enjoying it!

409
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,081
What?

410
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,930
This could be the affair
that you're scared of.

411
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,490
Politicians are
wonderful liars.

412
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,170
You never know
who they really are.

413
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,523
But he's probably not gay.
He's straight.

414
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,685
He's straight, so...

415
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,567
Excuse me, could I get
some more water? No.

416
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,447
Jan, you thought I had no
more cards left to play.

417
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,363
Well, I've got one.
Man-Boy!

418
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,682
The Ace of Babes.

419
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,801
Oh, my God.

420
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,961
Where's the Quiznos?

421
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,481
You're the Quiznos.

422
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,728
Jan, may I introduce
to you,

423
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,127
your own personal
Dunder Mifflin liaison,

424
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,649
devoted to servicing this account
with total client satisfaction.

425
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,803
I sense that Molly

426
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,560
wasn't quite
meeting your needs.

427
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,881
Nothing like
your old assistant.

428
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,564
Hunter,
was that his name?

429
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,569
I... I don't recall.
And yes, Molly is crap.

430
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,882
Okay, you do not
have to do this.

431
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,448
Do what? Get into sales?
That's what I want.

432
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,650
He's been growing
that mustache for weeks.

433
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,281
Best he can do.

434
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,371
So young.

435
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,210
Will you...

436
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,090
You. Can you
turn around for me, please?

437
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,202
Dwight, you can go. I will
call you in a week or so

438
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,169
and let you know whether
I want your business.

439
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,241
Thank you.
Very good.

440
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,610
Do you have
a valid passport?

441
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,921
Jim Halpert.

442
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,081
Hey, it's Colin.

443
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,811
Hey, man.
lam so sorry about that.

444
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,769
No, don't worry about it.

445
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,961
It's just,
it's not totally working.

446
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,966
Yeah, no, I know. This whole
telecommuting thing, not ideal.

447
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,246
But don't worry,
I'll figure it out.

448
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,961
Yeah, it's not just not ideal.
I mean, with you there,

449
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,929
I don't know how
we're going to do this.

450
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,969
What does...
What does that mean?

451
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,288
Oscar, what is
happening here?

452
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,966
Why would you say you think
the Senator might be gay?

453
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,281
I don't know, Angela.
I'm dehydrated.

454
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,530
Maybe you heard me wrong.
We should just go.

455
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,687
Look, look, here he comes! Here he comes.
He's coming, he's coming.

456
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,562
What is he doing? He's
making a phone call.

457
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,403
Hey, Molly.
You should just quit.

458
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,561
Yeah.
Yeah.

459
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,681
Thanks.

460
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,125
Oh, and Molly?

461
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,606
I know it can't be easy working for Jan.
Good luck with your feelings.

462
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,083
Dwight!
That was really nice.

463
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,363
You should ask
for her number.

464
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,806
I got her number.

465
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,244
Four-one-five-Y-C-L.

466
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,961
That's a license number?

467
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,281
That's all you need.

468
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,081
And when I have curried favor
with her, I will let you know.

469
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,205
Why me?

470
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,250
Because you are my friend
and you are a woman.

471
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,287
And women love gossip.
It's like air to you people.

472
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,364
Ugh. God!
