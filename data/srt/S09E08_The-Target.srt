00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,804
Yesterday, Angela may or may
not have figured out that

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,484
lam having an affair
with her husband.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,921
So I just have
to wait and see

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,481
when she comes in,
if she's cold and awkward

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,848
and cruel to me, then great,
it's business as usual.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,249
Good morning.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,321
Oscar.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,489
Can I ask you
a question?

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,606
Of course, ask me a...
Questions.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,169
Is it cool in here
to you?

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,326
Yes, a little bit. Yes!

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,325
I think that thermostat
is acting up again.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,851
It's the stupid
thermostat!

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,244
That thing's a catastrophe.
So, I'm going to...

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,926
...on your suggestion, get someone
to fix it! I'll just go downstairs.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,561
Thank you.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,761
No, thank you, Angela.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,731
She doesn't know.
I shouldn't be surprised.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,088
This is a woman who married a man
who is obviously a homosexual.

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,367
Basically she has
her head in the sand.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,843
In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess
the universe rewards true love.

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,003
Well,
it's finally happened.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,809
Pam has ceased caring.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,445
These are my painting clothes.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,441
I think I'm going to do it.
lam really going to start

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,329
painting the warehouse
mural today.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,607
Sure you don't want to put another
coat of primer on that, Pam?

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,284
Queen of the primer,
that one.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,124
You got this, Beesly.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,124
Actually, do you want me to come
down and help you get started?

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,440
Are you avoiding
your phone call?

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,126
What? Yeah, right. As if.

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,730
Today I will be
asking David Wallace

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,285
if I can start
working part-time,

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,362
because the sports marketing
company that I started

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,283
really needs me
to be there.

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,251
Last week, Jim wasn't there and
they named the company Athlead.

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,046
I could have
prevented that.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,088
So, lhaveto
talk to Wallace.

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,407
Tell them your opening line.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,682
Hey, David? How'd you like a
guy who's not here as much,

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,649
gets paid the same
amount of salary

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,882
and has bigger fish
to fry in Philadelphia?

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,249
I think it's good.
He likes fishing.

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,084
This is going
to be awful.

46
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,482
One of myjobs is to input customer
complaints into the computer.

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,047
And when they're in,
I fill out one of these cards.

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,248
But the information's
already on the computer.

49
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,244
So, why am I
filling out the card?

50
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,249
I asked Andy and he
told me to chillax.

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,087
And then went away
on a big, long boat ride.

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,162
So here we are.

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,965
Don't give me
a pointless office chore,

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,169
because I will build
a little paper house.

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,929
Fight the power.

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,242
Meet me in the old place.
Five minutes. I need you!

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,810
Come on in,
the water's fine.

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,569
Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting.
Put your clothes back on!

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,480
I know.
That's not why I'm naked.

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,568
I always work out
without my clothes.

61
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,689
Just put them on!
Put on your clothes.

62
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,921
I need your help. I need someone who
can operate outside of the law.

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,407
I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges
ended when you broke up with me.

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,051
If I'm not in your panties,
I don't go vigilantes.

65
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,810
Why don't you
ask your husband?

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,644
My marriage is in danger.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,121
I don't know who I can trust.

68
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,328
I need someone
to be there for me.

69
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,563
All right, what are we talking,
surveillance, wire-tapping?

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,846
Something like that.

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,490
Yeah. The less
I know the better.

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,166
I know just the guy. He was
a volunteer sheriff, too.

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,566
Kicked off the force.

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,005
Can you arrange a meeting?

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,485
I can try.

76
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,326
I'm going to use SMS text.
Okay.

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,927
The text went through.

78
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,121
Okay-

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,247
All we can do
is sit and wait.

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,321
Okay-

81
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,641
Oh!

82
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,845
Look at that. Yeah, he's free any time.
Not a problem.

83
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,842
I mean, I can handle any
client issues from Philly.

84
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,084
Yeah, but I really need someone
in the office, if there's a crisis.

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
The more I think about it...

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,760
You mean handle it
in person?

87
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,525
Well, Phyllis
and Stanley have agreed

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,329
to cover for me
while I'm gone.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,368
They did?
Yep.

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,044
Okay. Well, that is different. In
that case, yes, maybe this can work.

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,361
Great!

92
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,045
Why should we help you?

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,730
Because we are friends.

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,490
When is my birthday?

95
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,210
Unfair.
When's my birthday?

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,248
I don't know,
because we're not friends.

97
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,007
How about this? You let me take
you to lunch and I make my case.

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,003
Now we're talking.
All right.

99
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,206
Yeah.

100
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,451
Make it go taller.

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,325
Thafstheidea.

102
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,564
No, not taller this way,
taller this way.

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,929
Well, I've got to build a wider
base first before I can go higher.

104
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,723
You're not getting this, Peter.
Make it go wider, up.

105
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,800
Will do.

106
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,850
What are y'all doing?

107
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,968
Me and Pete are
building a tower.

108
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,447
Cool. It should be
taller though, right?

109
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,170
Obviously.

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,044
He's a sweet kid, Darryl, but not
the sharpest guy in the drawer.

111
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,683
Kevin, I can hear you.

112
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,361
Uh-huh.

113
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,930
Ow! Dwight! God.
Get in the van.

114
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,080
Is it safe to talk?

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,051
Well, this documentary crew has
been following our every move

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,284
for the past nine years, but I don't
see them, so I think we're good.

117
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,008
So. What are
your credentials?

118
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,846
I started following people
around to get exercise.

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,809
Turns out
I'm damn good at it.

120
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,724
Do you have a gun?

121
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,008
Does he own a gun?
Show her.

122
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,851
You tell me.

123
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,530
What is this?

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,648
That's the receipt
for my gun.

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,728
You don't carry it
with you?

126
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,963
Read the receipt.
That's a $300 gun.

127
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,561
Someone could steal it.

128
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,766
You have any idea
how many guns

129
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,006
Trevor has had
stolen from him?

130
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,321
Now I keep it in a safe.

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,211
A good safe?

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,971
You tell me.

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,401
Wow!

134
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,765
I guess if I make a mistake,

135
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,083
I can just paint over it
with a shrub or something.

136
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,845
It's just I think less of
paintings with a lot of shrubs,

137
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,288
so I'm going to limit
myself to one shrub.

138
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,521
You paint wall now?

139
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,003
Yeah! Painting now.

140
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,369
I just want to
make sure that...

141
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,687
You paint now?

142
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,242
I mean, it's probably going
to be a few minutes,

143
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,085
so you can just go back to
doing whatever you were doing.

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,766
I wait.

145
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,683
Sweet!
Yay!

146
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,807
This next card comes to us
thanks to Meredith Palmer,

147
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,204
who called Eastern Pennsylvania
Seminary a, quote, "sausage factory."

148
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,281
Oh!

149
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,206
All right.

150
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,530
Up next, we got
a whole lot of Creed.

151
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,887
Let's find out what I did.
All right.

152
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,487
You get half now and you get half
upon completion of said job.

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,011
And it's all
off the books?

154
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,321
Obviously.

155
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,890
Nice. No taxes.

156
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,009
Okay. So, everything you need to
know about the target is in here.

157
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,731
So, what's the job?

158
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,641
Murder.

159
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,526
Okay. That's the big one.
That's the big

160
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,646
You can't have
someone murdered!

161
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,171
What if they deserved it?

162
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,685
What did they
do to you, Angela?

163
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,245
They're sleeping
with my husband!

164
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,240
Monkey. I feel for you.

165
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,851
This seems a little crazy.

166
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,325
Yes, crazy! Thank you.

167
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,481
But I think I'm up for it. No!

168
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,688
Thank you!
No, absolutely not.

169
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,091
There are a lot of different
ways to get revenge.

170
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,528
I've had great success by defecating in
a paper bag, putting it on the porch.

171
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,601
That's very effective.

172
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,921
I've been on the receiving end
of that quite a few times.

173
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,771
It's devastating. No, no, no,
it has to be physical.

174
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,046
I want this person
to suffer.

175
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,361
What about a knee-capping?

176
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,408
No! You're not helping,
Trevor.

177
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,443
Yes! A knee-capping
could work.

178
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,570
No! Angela!
What are you saying?

179
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,364
You said you would
be there for me.

180
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,602
I'm trying,
but what you're asking is...

181
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,809
It's the only thing
that will make this right.

182
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,765
Okay. But it's cruel,

183
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,650
because a woman with damaged
knees can't scrub worth a damn.

184
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,249
All right, then it's
settled, one knee-capping.

185
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,725
Now, the hit goes down at 4:00.
Keep in mind, once I leave,

186
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,131
there's no turning back.

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,127
You know, truth be told, I
think all you'll really be doing

188
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,402
is accepting calls from my
clients while I'm gone.

189
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,086
We've got all afternoon
to talk about that.

190
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,207
Morning, folks.

191
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,642
I'll have the surf and turf,
with a side order of lobster.

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,128
Actually the surf and turf
does come with lobster.

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,123
Not enough lobster.
Side order.

194
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,288
How much wine do you have?

195
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,849
I brought you a cookie.

196
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,890
Thanks, Oscar,
you're such an angel.

197
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,080
I just gave her a cookie,
and she called me an angel,

198
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,447
so, yeah, we're good.

199
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,241
Yeah, we dodged a bullet.

200
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,561
Yes, okay. Yeah.

201
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,803
Yeah, well, I got to go now, but, okay.
Bye.Bye.

202
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,204
There we go!

203
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,441
Nicely done, very nicely done.
Nice.

204
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,809
All right, this next one goes to
Darryl for pocket-dialing a customer

205
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,086
while having sex.

206
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,401
Oh!

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,684
You salty dog.

208
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,730
Well, you know. What can I say?
Player's got to play.

209
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,801
There you go.

210
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,123
Actually that was the sound
of me eating spaghetti,

211
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,680
but I'm going to let them
think the other thing.

212
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,723
Okay, I got this one.

213
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,689
Be careful!
Be careful!

214
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,569
Easy does it, everyone.

215
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,520
Nobody even take a breath.

216
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,409
Kevin, don't.

217
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,044
Kevin! What did I say? What did I just say?
Look at that...

218
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,403
Hey, hey, hey! It's just a mistake.
It's just a mistake.

219
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,721
That's what this tower
is all about. Mistakes.

220
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,008
Okay? If you're afraid of screwing
up, this tower's not for you.

221
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,846
Show of hands, who here has never
had a complaint? That's right.

222
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,609
Nobody! See that? Nobody.

223
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,127
Okay? Let's get back
to work.

224
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,685
Come on. You in?

225
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,851
Yeah!
Yeah.

226
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,048
There we go.
All right, let's do it.

227
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,450
You know,
at the end of the day,

228
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,045
it's really only
two days, remember.

229
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,645
I mean, I'll be
back at the office,

230
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,563
and if you need me for
an emergency, call me.

231
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,325
You know what? I don't
know where the years went.

232
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,081
Because sometimes when I look at my
hands, I don't even recognize them.

233
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,647
Tell me about it.
Whose hands are these?

234
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,002
They're not my hands. Oh, no.

235
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,050
All right. You know what? Maybe
we'll just... We'll go slow.

236
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,451
No, Jim.

237
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,928
All right! Check it out. Yes!

238
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,367
Like a phoenix
from the ashes!

239
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,611
Nice. Pretty soon, we're
going to be at the ceiling.

240
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,483
Can you hand me a card?

241
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,846
It's empty-

242
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,451
What?
What?

243
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,885
Come on,
we could use a blank card.

244
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,086
No!
No!

245
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,321
That's cheating!

246
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,686
I could get us a complaint.

247
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,246
You? Little Miss Priss? You
wouldn't fart on a butterfly.

248
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,331
No, lwouldn't. I can't even
relate to that impulse.

249
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,647
But I bet I can get us a customer
complaint and I'd like to try.

250
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,846
Yeah! Go Pam!
All right.

251
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,402
Pam! Pam! Pam!
Pam! Pam! Pam!

252
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,050
Go, Pam! Go, Pam!

253
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,730
Pam! Pam! Pam!

254
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,006
Hey Kevin, let's...

255
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,281
Pam! Pam! Pam!

256
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,601
What? Why did you
call me out here?

257
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,445
The target.
It's Oscar, isn't it?

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,082
He and the Senator
are gaying each other.

259
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,446
I don't know what
you're talking about.

260
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,124
Your nostrils tell
a different story.

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,851
They flare like that every time
you're engaging in deception.

262
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,565
Hello again,
naughty nostrils.

263
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,481
Fine, it's Oscar! So what?

264
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,849
Well, I could understand you wanting
to get a stranger's knees whacked,

265
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,122
but a co-worker,
dare I say a friend?

266
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,046
Exactly, a friend, someone who
sits next to you, year after year,

267
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,690
making chit chat
and smiling.

268
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,923
And all the while running behind your
back, and defiling your marriage,

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,525
and seducing
your husband!

270
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,367
I can't even imagine how
painful this must be for you.

271
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,120
But the first ones to break your
marriage vows were you and me!

272
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,643
Well, you might be right.
But it's too late now.

273
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,247
What do you mean?

274
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,481
He's here.

275
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,286
No! No, no, no!

276
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,967
Oscar? Oscar! Oscar, good! Listen!
Hey, come with me!

277
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,491
What?
Come with me!

278
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,721
What are you doing?

279
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,086
There are a bunch of
construction workers

280
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,730
in the warehouse without their trousers...
I'm working.

281
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,484
...drinking diet sodas.

282
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,404
You have got to see this.
They're extraordinary.

283
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,970
Yahtzee!

284
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,847
Sandwich delivery
for Mr. Oscar Martinez.

285
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,081
I am Oscar Martinez.

286
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,847
No, not him, outside!
Outside!

287
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,121
What, what?

288
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,930
You know there's
donuts in the break room?

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,411
Nice!

290
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,210
Listen, I was
really wondering if maybe

291
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,970
we could lock this down
before lunch is over.

292
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,849
Don't be pushy, Jim.
It's tacky.

293
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,121
All right.

294
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,680
Phyllis! Phyllis!
That's decorative.

295
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,921
No, there's wine in here.

296
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,166
It's still decorative.

297
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,526
Is it white wine?
Nope.

298
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,125
Dude, hey, can you help me?

299
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,043
Don't poke people
with knives!

300
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,841
Ph u" u
y '8

301
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,121
Wow!

302
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,810
Bring it over.
Got it.

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,162
There's no time
to explain!

304
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,168
Dwight... Okay, actually
there is time to explain.

305
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,447
When Angela found out
that you seduced her husband,

306
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,045
we hired a guy
to break your kneecaps.

307
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,009
My God!
What is wrong with you?

308
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,043
What is wrong with you?

309
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,685
There are
a million gorgeous guys

310
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,404
in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre
area,

311
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,528
and you choose the man who
is the father of her child?

312
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,608
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, don't lie!

313
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,843
I'm trying to save those precious
knees you're always bragging about!

314
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,770
Now let's get out of here!
He could be right behind us!

315
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,129
Actually,
he's right in front of us!

316
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,487
Let's get it on.
I'm going to do this.

317
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,040
I might... I might puke,
but I'm going to do this.

318
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,043
No, Trevor.
I'm not going to let you.

319
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,128
He's a Dunder Mifflin man.
He's my tribe.

320
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,449
Sorry, Dwight, but for once
in my stupid, stupid life,

321
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,124
I'm going to follow through on something.
All right?

322
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,964
I have masculinity issues,
lhave“.

323
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,088
Stop! No!
Qkav-I got it!

324
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,969
Disarm!
You don't know...

325
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,842
lsummon,
I summon, I summon...

326
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,804
And disarm! Now!

327
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,530
Okay. Okay. Okay.

328
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,210
No, Oscar, no!
He's a friend!

329
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,685
Okay.
He's a friend.

330
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,448
Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire.
They're family owned,

331
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,443
but don't let that
take away your edge.

332
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,888
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail.
I see failure in you.

333
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,081
Remember, you're a scum bag, so you
think scummy thoughts, like this.

334
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,410
Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I'm
calling from Dunder Mifflin.

335
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,804
Yes, your paper provider.

336
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,521
And I just called to say

337
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,802
your mama is so fat,
when she wears red

338
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,370
people yell "Hey, Kool-Aid!"

339
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,364
Yeah, your mom is fat!
This is Pam Halpert!

340
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,764
- Did they say anything?
- What did they say?

341
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,008
I couldn't tell. I don't...
Were they angry?

342
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,884
I felt like they
were confused at least.

343
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,689
Okay.

344
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,846
Oh, my-

345
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,164
Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
Yes, you can.

346
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,281
Okay-

347
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,165
I will make sure
that goes on file.

348
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,483
Ladies and gentlemen,
we just lost a client!

349
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,602
Yes!
All right!

350
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,284
Come on! You did good.
You did good.

351
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,249
See you later, Heymont!

352
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,491
If you chase me,
I will run so fast.

353
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,365
If you catch me, I will bite so hard.
Got it?

354
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,251
Goodbye, my friend.

355
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,487
What the hell, Dwight?

356
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,726
See you later, Trevor!

357
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,525
You are incorrigible!

358
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,604
I just saved your life!
You're welcome!

359
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,085
You hired someone
to hit me with a pipe!

360
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,367
You deserve
every bit of it!

361
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,283
You made my husband gay!

362
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,291
What I did was wrong, and I have
to live with that every day.

363
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,449
But your husband is gay and he
was gay when you married him.

364
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,686
No, no.

365
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,000
Angela,
until you face that,

366
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,401
you're going to be confused and
angry for all the wrong reasons.

367
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,847
But if you want to blame
me for the whole thing,

368
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,008
go ahead.
I won't stop you.

369
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,889
Hit me, you have my blessing.
Hit me!

370
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,521
Well, are you
going to let go of it?

371
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,841
Because part of the blame
is definitely on you.

372
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,967
Angela,
it's a lead fricking pipe!

373
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,167
God!

374
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,851
You were supposed
to be my friend!

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,445
I'm so sorry! Angela!

376
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,681
Oscar.

377
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,482
Our crowning complaint card comes
to us thanks to Pamela Halpert.

378
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,768
For insulting a client's
recently deceased mother.

379
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,086
I did not know that.
No.

380
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,721
A woman who struggled
with obesity all her life.

381
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,450
I am so sorry.

382
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,320
Yeah, that is terrible.

383
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,731
All right!

384
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,330
Go, Pam!

385
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,369
You did it!

386
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,168
I feel so stupid.
I sit next to him every day.

387
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,410
You're not stupid.
Jazz is stupid.

388
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,801
Jazz is stupid! I mean,
just play the right notes!

389
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,883
I know.

390
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,884
You're going to
be okay, Monkey.

391
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,001
Idon%Hke
your friend Trevor.

392
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,368
I don't like him either.

393
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,330
And yet,
I really like him.

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,128
Well, we're here.

395
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,570
Perfect.

396
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,607
We're going to cover for you, you know?

397
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,083
Phyllis, what was that? Phyllis,
are you dreaming, or...

398
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,645
I did enjoy
grinding your beans, son.

399
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,485
Yeah, we really
did peel your grapes.

400
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,006
This is hilarious. But we're
going to stop with all the...

401
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,451
Shucking your peas!

402
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,891
Shucking my peas.

403
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,009
All right, just go back to the first part.
You are going to cover for me?

404
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,486
Yeah.

405
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,131
Of course we are, Jimmy.
We love you guys.

406
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,569
Oh, my God!
Thank you. Thank you.

407
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,041
If you're an artist, you have
to be okay with the idea

408
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,009
that you can't please
everybody all the time.

409
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,366
You paint very bad, bad!

410
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,845
Shut up, Hide!

411
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,722
I mean, do you think Kevin cares
what people think about him?

412
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,928
Or Creed? Or Meredith?

413
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,930
Oh, my gosh,
these are my role models now.

414
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,406
You know what?
I'm okay with that.

415
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,963
Where does gayness come from
and how is it transmitted?

416
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,490
Now that is
a loaded question.

417
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,040
My pastor said it can
come from breast feeding.

418
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,446
He said that?

419
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,090
Well, he didn't
fight me hard on it.

420
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,887
I don't know if
there's truth to that.

421
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,807
What is it called when two
men intertwine their penises

422
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,850
like the snakes on
the medic-alert bracelet?

423
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,481
Uh...

424
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,530
Is it called Red Vine-ing?

425
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,562
We heard it was called Red Vine-ing.
People Red-Vine?

426
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,849
Where are
gay men's vaginae?

427
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,090
They don't have vaginae.

428
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,440
What?

429
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,010
No. They're just
regular men.

430
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,481
When two gay men have sex,

431
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,325
how do they know
whose penis will open up

432
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,687
to accept
the other person's penis?

433
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,521
Wow.
