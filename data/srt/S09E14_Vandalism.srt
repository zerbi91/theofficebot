1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,967
Have you seen Darryl?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,087
He's around here somewhere.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,561
Hmm.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,080
Yeah, Darryl's here.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,646
So's Santa Claus.
It's just a regular Thursday.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,841
Neither guy is here!
And it's Friday!

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,651
Welcome to me and
Darryl's world of lies!

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,608
Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl
already started working in Philly.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,566
So now he has to
sneak out of here like the

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,723
sneakiest little
sneaky-sneak you ever saw.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,804
And I'm his helper!
It's so fun.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,889
Darryl, meet Bear-yl.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,366
How much did
you pay for that?

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,124
Nothing.
Won him at the carnival.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,969
Spent a ton on tickets,
though.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,281
Drive safe!

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,528
Everybody knows
I go to Philly.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,728
I've just been using
sick days I saved up.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,805
But Erin was so excited about being
sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,962
Darryl,
you are too much!

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,641
That guy's hilarious.
He's here today.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,846
I've really been putting in
the hours on this mural.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,965
And my boss is totally okay with
it, because he's in the Bahamas

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,527
and has no clue
what anybody is doing.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,088
I'm usually very self-critical.
I hate what I paint,

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,130
but I don't know, this time
I feel like it's, um...

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,089
It's really coming together.
Oh, my God!

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,290
You've got to be kidding me!

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,681
What is... Are those...
Are those butts?

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,321
Huh?

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,045
No way. No way!

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,962
Excuse me, everyone. Is it okay
if I leave early from work today?

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,329
It's Phillip's first birthday,
and the Senator

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,204
and I are hosting
a party at our house.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,369
Oh, cute! So there'll
be a bunch of kids?

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,565
No, no children. Our
house is not kid-friendly.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,644
Most of our
furniture is sharp.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,481
Also, ew.

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,608
It will mostly be
campaign donors.

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,444
Angela, lam prepared
to donate a whopping

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,566
$8 to Lipton For America
to have an invitation...

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,290
No, no. Please.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,407
You know,
actually, none of you

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,448
could even really make
the cut for this thing.

45
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,767
Which I am so sad about!

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,526
Angela. You're going to find out,
so I thought I'd let you know

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,925
that, uh,
Robert invited me, too.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,526
What?

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,086
He said he wanted
me there for support.

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,401
I'm...

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,850
His wife.

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,283
Angela's husband
and I are in love.

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,010
Butas
a politician in this town,

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,243
you still need the conventional
blonde wife on your lawn signs.

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,322
He is risking everything
to have me there today.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,131
Me!

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,530
We agreed that you wouldn't be
seen with him in public.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,684
It's humiliating for me.

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,205
Well, if you get to bring
a stud, maybe I do, too.

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,527
Hey-
Hey-

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,967
We are splitting a sublet
on a place near Philly.

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,010
Just a couple of grown,
sexy-ass roommates.

63
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,320
And as much as I
miss Pam and the kids,

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,449
it's, uh, kind of nice to live the bachelor
life again. You know? Let your hair down?

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,048
Jim was nice enough
to give me his bedroom...

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm couching it!

67
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,966
...which usually means there
are clothes all over the living room.

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,203
And this
dude labels his food.

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,365
He's the clean one, I'm the messy one.
How much fun is this?

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,127
I love Jim. I love that
he hooked me up with a job.

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,327
It's just, he uses old
T-shirts as washrags.

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,807
He doesn't wash his dishes.
Apparently they need to "soak."

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,484
He hooked me up with a job.

74
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,931
Attention, everyone! Can I
have your attention, please?

75
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,730
Yeah, I don't know everybody's
name down here,

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,962
but whoever did this, will
you please raise your hand?

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,410
Hello? This is not over, okay?

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,286
I will stay up here all day if I have to.
Is that what you want?

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
Yeah, I will also come down if I want to.
It's my choice.

80
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,930
PAM".
I don't demand justice often.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,968
I'm not like Angela,
who calls a lawyer

82
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,566
every time someone watches a
YouTube video of animals doing it.

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,166
But someone should get
fired over this, right?

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,411
Val's no help.
Andy's gone. Jim's out.

85
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,564
I just feel like
I'm on my own here.

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,646
I mean, okay,
not completely on my own,

87
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,161
but in terms of people
who can do something.

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,571
Thank you, Brian.

89
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,451
Hey, so, Wade wants to send
people to the Sloan Conference.

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,329
We got to compile
a list of our target clients.

91
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,528
Already on it. I ordered them
by their Google Trend rankings,

92
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,647
so we know who to hit first.

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,807
Who is this guy?

94
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,961
We are killing it.

95
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,805
Yes, sir!
Yeah!

96
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,329
Conference room.
Everybody. Now!

97
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,481
You don't have the clearance to
call a conference-room meeting.

98
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,005
Yes, but David Wallace does,

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,686
and he asked me to gather
everyone to talk about stuff

100
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,366
that's gonna be revealed once we're in
the conference room for the meeting.

101
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,241
You're telling me
David Wallace asked you

102
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,171
to call a super-secret, classified
conference-room meeting?

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,287
Yeah.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,409
Let's go, everyone!
Super-secret,

105
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,323
classified
conference-room meeting! Now!

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,286
Let's go.

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,566
I have terrible news.

108
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,650
Somebody defaced my mural.
What?

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,449
They painted all over it.

110
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,684
I thought that's
what you were doing.

111
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,524
Yeah, but this is different.
Oh.

112
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,370
They used worse
paint than your paint?

113
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,601
I don't think so.
But they put paint

114
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,926
where I didn't want paint.
So...

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,604
I thought you wanted paint
on the whole thing.

116
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,927
Different colored paint.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,445
I wanted
different colored paint

118
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,085
in the spots where
they put their paint.

119
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,971
So, it just is...
Okay, the point is,

120
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,128
these warehouse
guys are vandals,

121
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,326
and they need to be stopped.

122
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,011
Yeah,
and somebody had the balls

123
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,323
to put my phone number on the men's
room wall, which is so messed up.

124
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,647
It's 6-7-8-2, not 8-3!

125
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,248
Uh, 6-7-8-3 is also
a good time. Less mileage.

126
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,211
Pam, what can be done?

127
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,807
Yes. Thank you!
Let's answer that question.

128
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,884
I was politely saying nothing can be done.
I thought I was clear.

129
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,851
What?
Come on, guys! We need to

130
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,962
figure out who did
this and punish them!

131
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,964
This isn'tjust about me, this is
about all of us. This is our mural!

132
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,682
Don't you see how much we worked on this?
How much time and energy?

133
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,047
We put our heart and
soul into this thing.

134
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,451
David Wallace
called this meeting?

135
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,766
Sure did.

136
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,683
I was as surprised
as you, but apparently

137
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,922
he is very
passionate about public art.

138
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,486
No, no, come on, guys!
Don%go!

139
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,289
Pam? I'll help you.

140
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,361
You Will?

141
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,284
If there's anything I hate
worse than art, it's crime.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,005
Thank you.
lam in too, Pam.

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,565
Yeah?
Yes, of course!

144
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,127
I believe in you,
I believe in your art,

145
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,446
and I am bored.

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,327
Great!

147
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,970
I was hoping for
a righteous mob.

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,650
I ended up with
Dwight and Nellie.

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,203
But they both
have a mob mentality.

150
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,201
And I'm pretty sure Dwight
has a pitchfork in his car.

151
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,964
You need my pitchfork?

152
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,281
Hey-

153
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,249
What is it?
I have vengeance to exact.

154
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,563
Exciting news. There's room for one
more at my son's birthday event,

155
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,404
and I want you.

156
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,801
Ah! I'm not interested.

157
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,611
Wait, wait! The State Transportation
Secretary will be there.

158
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,969
You could sell your beet-salt
idea to the highway people. Ah!

159
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,730
If I get the de-icing gig,
it's going to be

160
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,405
on merit, not
because I played politics.

161
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,409
Hey. So, a little
birdie just told me that

162
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,721
Dwight can't come to
your son's birthday.

163
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,680
So, do you want me to go with you?
No.

164
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,406
Okay, I understand.
I'll just stay here, then,

165
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,369
alone with the money.

166
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,086
Oh, crap.

167
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,408
I am handing out
pieces of paper

168
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,644
on which you will draw one human butt.
What I do with said drawings

169
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,245
is no one's
business but my own.

170
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,448
You're going to compare them
to the butts up there.

171
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,410
Incorrect. it is my fetish.
Oh, also, sign them.

172
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,284
My fetish is signed
drawings of butts.

173
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,090
I'm not drawing a butt.

174
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,730
All right, then, no bottoms.

175
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,043
Uh... We should ask you to
do big rounded W's.

176
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,367
Yes, or nippleless breasts,
perhaps.

177
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,046
Okay. Okay, I think it's time to get
back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.

178
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,690
Or melons, like cantaloupes,

179
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,649
with,
like, the halves are cut off

180
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,683
and then just
the bottom parts...

181
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,524
Well,
this is getting us nowhere.

182
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,446
We need another approach. We
need to find the weakest one

183
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,683
and separate him
from the group.

184
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,165
Yeah, I think if we could get
Nate alone, we could crack him.

185
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,166
We just need
a pretense to talk to him.

186
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,890
We could tell him
that his mother is dying.

187
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,451
That usually works on him.

188
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,086
Nate!

189
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,050
Your mother is dying!

190
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,960
See? I feel bad about that. Good.
That's all right, that's all right.

191
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,010
So she's going to
pull through again?

192
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,283
That's great.
Can I talk to her?

193
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,165
No. She needs her rest again.

194
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,768
Now, listen.
Now that we've got you here,

195
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,609
let's talk about
this mural business.

196
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,920
You know who the vandal is.

197
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,850
Now, I know a lot of these
warehouse guys are your friends,

198
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,849
but we've got chewing gum.

199
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,842
Gum's gotten mintier lately,
have you noticed?

200
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,322
Like,
some of it is just too minty.

201
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,130
It's like they're literally
trying to hurt your mouth.

202
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,964
Tell us who
defaced the mural!

203
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,124
He did it.

204
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,327
All right, you can go.
Give him his gum.

205
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,682
There's no gum.
There never was any gum!

206
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,885
That's really rude.

207
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,843
Opening with puff pastries?
That's a bold play.

208
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,241
They're saying, "it's only going to
get better from here? Good luck."

209
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,804
That painting is just...

210
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,450
How can anyone that weighs less
than a guinea hen be so terrifying?

211
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,126
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator and Angela Lipton.

212
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,649
Thanks, everybody,
thanks for coming.

213
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,371
Phillip had no idea
he was so popular.

214
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,202
Oh, Robert, you're horrible.

215
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,926
Simon, Maxine,
who let you guys in here?

216
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,409
This is the team.

217
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,404
Nice job, man.

218
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,164
You too, Darryl.

219
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,761
What?

220
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,485
Oh, man.
I'm sorry about that.

221
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,650
It's cool.
Reading is tricky sometimes.

222
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,961
Oh, are you really
mad about this?

223
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,089
That's my go-to thermos, that's all.
Oh, it's your go-to...

224
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,770
Oh, man, that's a bummer.
I'm sorry about that.

225
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,001
No big deal, no big deal.

226
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,281
No, if it's a big deal,
it's a big deal.

227
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,805
No, no, no.
No big deal.

228
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,609
No, no, no, no, no!
You don't have to do that!

229
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,404
Honestly, I don't mind.

230
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,766
Did want me to
wash it for you, or...

231
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,251
I don't know.
Are you going to wash it,

232
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,845
or you gonna let it soak?

233
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,487
Okay-

234
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,441
Here you go.

235
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,966
Thank you!

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,608
So, Frank, do you have any thoughts,
about what was done? By you.

237
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,201
Maybe... Maybe I could get
the ball rolling. Mmm-hmm.

238
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,851
Um, Frank?

239
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,210
Hi. Pam.

240
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,128
Um, lam so sorry if I've
done anything to offend you.

241
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,648
I'm sure it isn't
easy for you guys

242
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,685
to have an upstairs person
coming down in yourspace, so“.

243
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,961
Truly, if... I apologize.

244
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,250
But enough about me.
Your turn.

245
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,163
Insert apology here, Frank?

246
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,328
I'm sorry I didn't
like your crappy doodles.

247
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,050
I drew a butt.
Big deal. Butts are funny.

248
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,643
Well, I didn't think
that butt was funny.

249
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,365
Well, maybe if you got
the stick out of yours...

250
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,930
What was that?
You know what?

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,005
You people can't
fire me, so screw you.

252
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,003
Whoa! Hey! That is not okay!

253
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,931
What are you going
to do about that?

254
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,530
It... Compliment.

255
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,841
The first "sorry"
sounded sincere.

256
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,250
There were two or three sorrys in there.
So it's a lot.

257
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,521
Thatsucked.
He didn't apologize.

258
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,045
There's no
talking to that guy.

259
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,600
Oh, your little feelings party
didn't work out, huh?

260
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,162
Who won the hugging contest? No, let
me guess. Everyone tied for first.

261
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,446
We should just take him down.

262
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,005
Wait, are you saying...

263
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,209
I'm saying we should go
scorched-earth on that guy's face.

264
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,168
Normally,
I find Pam to be a comforting

265
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,282
if unarousing
presence around the office,

266
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,283
like a well-watered fern.

267
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,880
But today, she has
tapped into this vengeful,

268
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,123
violent side,
and I'm like, "Wow,

269
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,369
"Pam has kind of a good butt!"

270
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,123
He messed with something
that was important to you.

271
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,043
We need to mess with something
that's important to him.

272
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,323
A little eye-for-an-eye action.
Yes! Yes!

273
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,402
Go all
Hammurabi on this clown.

274
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,451
We need an infiltrator.

275
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,967
I know just
the man for the job.

276
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,726
Clark?

277
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,924
He even looks like a mole.

278
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,846
One of his tee shots can wipe
out a whole owl population.

279
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,088
You two seem very close.

280
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,608
Yes, we're good friends.
Good friends. Yeah.

281
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,088
And I suppose that may
ruffle a few feathers.

282
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,086
Because for a long time,
our party

283
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,966
has turned its back on
the Hispanic people.

284
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,608
Well, that is not who I am. lam a
friend of the Latino community.

285
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,206
And if you ask me, it's time
we bid bigotry hasta luego.

286
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,361
Now, does my embrace
of Hispanics make me

287
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,881
more electable,
given demographic trends?

288
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,803
I don't know,
and I don't care.

289
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,088
What I care about is Oscar.

290
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,203
My friend, mi amigo, Oscar.

291
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,605
Maybe I should be insulted
that he only invited me here

292
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,083
to be his token
Mexican friend,

293
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,649
but he could have invited any
number of Hispanics that he knows.

294
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,050
His gardener, Rohelio,
or he could have invited...

295
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,327
Rohelio,

296
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,526
but he chose me.

297
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,168
Rohelio's Malaysian.

298
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,164
That son of
a bitch is Malaysian.

299
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,046
Oh, hey.
Hey.

300
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,523
Hey, I usually watch TV during
my lunch break. That's cool?

301
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,131
Yeah, totally.
All right.

302
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,531
It's mine, don't worry.

303
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,721
I didn't say anything.

304
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,001
I don't think you had to.

305
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,801
Excuse me?

306
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,484
I think you might be going a little
crazy with this labeling thing, man.

307
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,650
I mean, you put your name
on a five-pound bag of flour.

308
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,040
Are you honestly saying that if I
needed flour, I couldn't use that?

309
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,327
What do you need
flour for, Jim?

310
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,401
That's not the point.

311
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,608
What, you making bread?
No, I'm not making bread.

312
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,727
What bread you making?
Pumpernickel?

313
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,211
Darryl, it doesn't matter.
Darryl! I think you know

314
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,281
the point I'm trying to make!

315
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,005
All right, I'm being ajerk.

316
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,727
You got me this job.
I should be grateful.

317
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,362
I am, I just... You know, I get a little
finicky about my stuff. That's all.

318
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,203
It's all good.
Are we all good?

319
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,240
We good.

320
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,885
What's that cooler?

321
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,485
Nothing. It's mine.

322
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,250
What happened to
my Tavis Smileys?

323
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,889
Oh, crap, were those yours?

324
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,401
I never want to
see you working

325
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,450
in the upstairs office again!
Do you hear me?

326
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,490
But my only crime was
loving the local sports teams

327
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,050
and trying to be
one of the guys!

328
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,851
Silence! You will now be
working in the warehouse

329
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,804
with the untouchables.

330
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,725
Now, go make your
hands rough with work!

331
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,605
Okay, boss!

332
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,003
Pam, you know this is
ridiculous, right? Okay.

333
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,923
You're smarter than this.

334
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,800
This is never going to work!

335
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,241
Remember your lines.

336
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,328
What lines?
Go move some paper!

337
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,123
Hey, you know that guy Frank
who works in the warehouse?

338
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,010
He's not my hire,
but I know who he is.

339
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,969
Okay, what is he like?
What's important to him?

340
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,566
Does he have, like, a favorite pair
of boots, or a lunch box, or...

341
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,922
What, is he retiring? You getting
him a gift or something?

342
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,241
Yeah, something like that.

343
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,731
I know he loves
his pickup truck.

344
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,131
Oh, great! His truck!

345
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,363
Great, get the plate number.
Okay, do you know the plate...

346
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,044
Never mind.
Why would you know that?

347
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,451
And why would I
be asking that?

348
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,965
So we know which truck to...

349
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,326
Hey,
while I got you on the phone,

350
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,927
your husband is like a sloppy
homeless hobo. Can you fix that?

351
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,248
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could.
I got to go, bye.

352
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,121
Come on.

353
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,043
Hold on a second. Uh, Sundeep, let's
get you closer to the Senator.

354
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,884
Just about there. Great.

355
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,883
And Oscar,
I'm going to need you to step

356
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,923
a little closer to
the Senator as well.

357
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,883
Somewhere there.
He's blocking me.

358
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,206
It's only a photo, honey.

359
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,526
Excuse me, what's your name?

360
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,886
Shawn.
Lashawn, great.

361
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,406
You want to be in a photo?
Right this way. Not you.

362
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,970
No, he put me here.

363
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,565
He put you right in front of me?
Yes, he did.

364
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,880
He put you right in front of me?
Yes!

365
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,409
Now, let's just wheel Margaret
right in front here. Ow!

366
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,725
Oscar. Angela.
Robert...

367
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,211
Smile!

368
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,005
I'm done. What are you...

369
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,324
lsthatsupposed
to be my mural?

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,048
Yeah. Frank draws
a butt on your mural,

371
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,010
I'm drawing your mural
on Frank's truck's butt.

372
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,691
Eye for an eye, mamacita.

373
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,330
Oh,
Dwight, that's really sweet.

374
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,809
Let's see yours. Oh, no, I'm embarrassed.
It's stupid.

375
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,841
This is amazing!
That's Frank!

376
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,965
And he's leaving
a trail of poops?

377
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,361
Yeah.
And he has saggy boobs.

378
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,485
Yeah, I saw that.
That's great!

379
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,330
I feel better.

380
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,603
Good,
I'm glad you feel better.

381
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,882
This has been a wonderful day.
I have to say,

382
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,044
I like hanging out
with a vengeful bitch.

383
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,921
I know.
You miss Angela, don't you?

384
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,521
Don't sympathize. You're
ruining the mood. Back to work!

385
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,285
Draw his penis!

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,049
I got back at Frank in the
most fitting way possible.

387
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,610
With my art.

388
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,561
You know,
the paints are water-based,

389
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,806
it's going to
come off with a hose,

390
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,961
but I think
the lesson will last a...

391
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,161
Lady!

392
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,726
My truck? You had no right!

393
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,211
No, you had no right!

394
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,442
It's a $40,000 truck!

395
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,681
So? You started it!

396
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,444
So? So somebody
needs to shut you up!

397
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,045
BRIA . N. Hey, hey, hey! Ah!

398
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,401
Whoa!

399
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,609
- Easy!
- Son of a bitch!

400
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,727
Guys!

401
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,001
You're going to hit a woman?

402
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,367
Thanks so much for coming.

403
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,487
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

404
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,646
Well!

405
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,962
Have we all calmed down yet?

406
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,725
Yes. Sorry about that.

407
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,604
It was all my fault.

408
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,849
Let's all try to
do better next time.

409
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,570
Kevin, great to see you.

410
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,091
Yeah. Thank you for the food.

411
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,321
Oh, and also,

412
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,561
you suck.

413
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,441
I beg your pardon?

414
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,325
You're,
like, a terrible person.

415
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,123
These guys care about you,
and you're just using them.

416
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,769
Again, the food was very good.

417
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,244
Well, I'm going to say
something to the producers.

418
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,209
No, no. It's...
You shouldn't be fired.

419
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,925
I mean,
you were just protecting me.

420
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,367
It's all good. I knew
what I was doing. It's...

421
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,363
I'm sorry about your mural, though.
I mean, because...

422
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,771
Oh, no.
You put so much into that.

423
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,046
Forget about my mural.
It's stupid.

424
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,446
No, you worked hard on that.

425
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,245
That guy's an animal. I'm
glad they're firing him, too.

426
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,481
This is crazy.

427
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,725
Brian, I'm so sorry.

428
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,961
Look“.

429
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,043
I don't... I don't want to put
myself where I don't belong.

430
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,805
If you ever need me, you just call
me and I'll be there for you.

431
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,125
Thanks, Bflan.

432
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,046
See you.

433
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,571
Wow. This whole Philly
thing has been so much fun

434
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,605
that I may have lost sight
of what really matters.

435
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,284
I mean, having fun is
not nearly as important

436
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,681
as being good to the people
who you really care about.

437
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,521
I mean,
that's just Roommates 101.

438
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,883
Oh! Come on!
Oh!

439
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,685
Oh!
Damn!

440
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,640
"You Win!"

441
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,409
How good did that feel? That
felt really good, actually.
