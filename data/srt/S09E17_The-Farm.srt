1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,201
Hold it!

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,761
New glasses.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,289
Dwight, what a ridiculous,
fancy clown you are.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,445
I am dressed according to the
Schrute codes of mourning.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,004
My Aunt Shirley has died.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,841
Oh! Dwight, I'm so sorry.
Were you guys close?

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,121
I would say
that she raised me,

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,884
but let's not kid each other.
I raised myself.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,881
She was, however, the closest
thing I had to a mother.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,770
My actual mother was
very cold and distant.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,889
I'd say she was the closest
thing I had to an aunt.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,961
My condolences.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,041
- Keep them!
- Okay.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,565
Now, what do we got
in these two pails?

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,210
In keeping with
Schrute custom,

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,726
I will either invite you
to Saturday's funeral

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,600
by sprinkling red, fertile
dirt in your face,

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,241
or I will ask you to keep a respectful
distance during my time of grief

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,403
with a dusting of black,
slightly acidic soil.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,806
What color is it?

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,241
It looks pretty black.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,486
Yep. Acidic all right.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,609
Oh, thank God.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,647
Excuse me?

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,767
I'm so sorry, Dwight.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,128
And if you want me to be
there, of course I will go.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,124
It's just, I have a
personal training session.

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,810
Okay, that's not...
I just can't...

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,889
I get red dirt.
Nobody is getting red dirt.

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,691
I should've kept
my mouth shut.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,246
We're not even that close.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,011
I've only known
Dwight 12 years.

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,330
Twelve years.
Time is a son of a bitch.

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,364
I'm sure
she's in a better place.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,330
I really hope so.

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,364
Okay, now this is crazy.
You can't make a dirtball...

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,363
I miss her so much.
Okay.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,967
You know?

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,802
There's a bright
golden haze on the meadow

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,090
A bright golden
haze on the meadow

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,041
Zeke's here. Zeke!

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,044
Hey, Dwight.
Mose, Mom says hi.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,645
Hi to Mom.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,401
You going?

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,761
Will there be
ghosts there?

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,762
Get in the sidecar.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,888
Get in the sidecar. Get...
You get in the sidecar.

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,681
What are you
doing here?

49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,451
You invited me. You threw
the red dirt in my face.

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,849
Oh, yeah.

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,407
Who is that?

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,527
Jeb, my brother.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,009
You have a brother? Mmm-hmm.

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,969
I didn't really see
a better parking spot.

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,885
Oh!

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,923
LOOK what I did.

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,361
It's a rental.

58
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,891
You wanna go in? No, you do!

59
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,485
You wanna go in?
You wanna go in?

60
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,971
I'll put you in there.
Okay, I'll put you.

61
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,804
Here we go.

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,281
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle!

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,928
Oh, gosh.
Hey, moon face.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,283
Nice to see those shiny
little Chinese eyes of yours.

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,487
Who's this guy?

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,647
Bad.

67
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,926
Hi, all!

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,047
Why are you here, Todd?

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,408
Okay, let's get
right to it, I guess.

70
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,086
My name is Todd Packer,
and I am in recovery.

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,371
I'm working the steps. I'm on step
eight of Alcoholics Anonymous,

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,761
step nine of
Narcotics Anonymous.

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,729
I'm here
to make amends.

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,890
I've been hard to deal
with over the past years.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,207
Kind of a jerk.
I know it.

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,891
I don't need you
to accept my apology,

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,887
but I'd love it
if you did.

78
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,448
Packer, we accept.

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,123
Actually, they have a specific
way I need to do this,

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,089
and I have to go through
examples of stuff.

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,527
Okay, where to begin? Hey.

82
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,602
Pam Pam and her pampams.

83
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,487
Well, I have said some
crude things about those.

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,566
But they are beautiful,

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,170
and I guess that's
why I acted out.

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,527
Pam, I'm sorry
I objectified you

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,441
and personified
your breasts.

88
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,410
Sorry, guys-

89
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,690
Oh, boy. I have
not been nice to you.

90
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,011
Phylly, I'm sorry for the
things I said about your size

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,081
to your face,
behind your back,

92
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,321
and in the form
of drawings.

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,528
Actually, that goes to all you double XLs.
Stanley, Kevin,

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,291
this kid
in a few years.

95
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,929
Todd, you're just saying insults
in the form of an apology.

96
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,206
Why can't I just be nice?

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,925
Truth is, I really like
you guys. I really do.

98
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,802
Okay, the apology's
just half of it.

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,008
The big thing
is making amends,

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,844
and that's why
I brought these.

101
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,524
I went out to
the Steamtown mall,

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,002
and I got you all cupcakes
from that place Nipples.

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,283
- Think it's called Nibbles.
- Ha!

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,604
The mind sees
what it wants to, huh?

105
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,525
Hmm. Oh.

106
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,565
There you go.

107
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,521
Hey, hey. guys. Wait.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,684
Before we accept
these cupcakes,

109
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,206
I think we need to
have a conversation privately

110
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,281
in the conference room.

111
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,729
Don't eat the cupcake.

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,649
We are here today to join
this woman and the ground.

113
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,251
Man is born of woman, and his
life is full of turmoil.

114
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,482
It's crap soil. Nothing's
gonna grow here.

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,768
It doesn't matter.
It's a cemetery.

116
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,922
Yeah, well, I'm saying
it's garbage soil, that's all.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,128
Well, the only thing we're
planting here is dead bodies.

118
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,123
That's fine, 'cause
they're not gonna grow.

119
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,248
Well, I thank God
they're not,

120
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,810
because we don't
wanna make zombies.

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,685
Good. I agree. Don't worry about it.
You won't get any.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,367
Would the family
care to say something?

123
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,211
You had black hair
and then gray hair.

124
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,204
You were the aunt
to my cousins.

125
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,328
Most of your life,
you were 5'4".

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,488
At the end,
you were 5'1".

127
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,842
They're a descriptive people.

128
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,480
I see you
started without me.

129
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,607
You were late,

130
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,409
so... What am I
supposed to do?

131
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,130
Hi, Fanny. How are you? Hey.

132
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,281
Who is that?

133
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,361
Dwight's sister.

134
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,090
Dwight has a sister? Yeah.

135
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,164
She's beautiful.

136
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,730
Blech.

137
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,443
Hello, little man. Haven't
seen you in a few years.

138
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,530
What is this?
Oh, God.

139
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,809
Just...
Whatdid you...

140
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,807
Henry.

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,881
Dwight.

142
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,608
I see
Esther's back in town.

143
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,041
Hi, Dwight.

144
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,121
Hi, Esther.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,611
Nice of you
to come today.

146
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,405
This was on the way.

147
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,803
We're going into town after.
I need yarn.

148
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,288
Well, if you can snap two chicken
necks with a single motion,

149
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,523
why use two motions
to slaughter those chickens?

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,767
We're at a funeral. There's
a funeral going on here.

151
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,080
Okay-
Okay-

152
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,446
Anyone mention
her height?

153
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,521
Yep-

154
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,726
Land size?

155
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,364
Shirley, at 1,600 acres, you have
the largest farm in the area,

156
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,046
sharing borders
with six other farms,

157
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,771
including my own farm
and your nephew Dwight's.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,001
Okay-

159
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,041
So, let's get it going.

160
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,722
Would you want
to do the honors?

161
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,365
Oh, right, uh,

162
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,442
you know, I don't think
we have to do this.

163
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,329
We Schrutes don't need
some Harvard doctor

164
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,131
to tell us who's alive
and who's dead.

165
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,690
But there was
an unlucky streak

166
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,728
of burying some
heavy sleepers.

167
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,531
And when grave robbers
discovered some scratch marks

168
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,046
on the inside
of some of the coffins,

169
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,884
we decided to make
sure that our dead

170
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,884
were completely dead,
out of kindness.

171
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,364
That's it for me.

172
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,925
I don't think we should
eat Packer's cupcakes.

173
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,041
We can't give him the satisfaction.

174
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,167
I agree.

175
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,727
Even though that place has a
way of making those cupcakes

176
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,041
so they're dense but
they're also really fluffy.

177
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,481
We can't let him buy our
forgiveness with cupcakes.

178
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,530
He was awful to us.
And he still is.

179
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,569
How much
is a cupcake, $2.50?

180
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,801
Is that the price
of our dignity?

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,721
$3.75 a cupcake actually,
$3.67 if you buy a dozen.

182
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,447
I never forget a number. Names,
in one ear and out the other.

183
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,928
Places, nope.
Faces, that's rich.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,685
But numbers,
I have a gift.

185
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,242
I guess that's why
I'm an accountant.

186
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,128
Hey, man, I don't think
we've met. I'm Clark.

187
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,281
Oh. I'm Todd. Sorry for calling
you a fat little runt earlier.

188
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,762
You didn't
actually say that.

189
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,569
No?
No.

190
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,571
Wow! I'm in this mode now
where I'm apologizing

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,846
for thoughts
that are in my head.

192
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,809
Hmm.

193
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,007
Hey!

194
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,925
I have a crazy feeling that you
are really gonna like this.

195
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,609
Maybe we should
eat the cupcakes.

196
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,405
Haven't we done
enough to Packer?

197
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,767
I mean, we've sent him down
to Florida on a prank,

198
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,966
and you did fire him.

199
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,280
I did. I did, yes.

200
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,681
And it was purely political.
He did nothing wrong.

201
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,330
Would any of you be
saying any of this

202
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,731
if the cupcakes
were from Supermart?

203
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,370
Do they even have
a bakery anymore?

204
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,124
They do. It's awful!

205
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,248
And it's getting
worse every day.

206
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,607
So, it really is just
about the cupcakes.

207
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,170
Wow, you're right. It is
just about the cupcakes.

208
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,720
So, we're all agreed no one
touches those cupcakes?

209
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,290
Okay-
Okay-

210
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,249
Packer can go to hell.

211
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,524
Thank you for coming
to my funeral.

212
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,444
As I gaze
at life's big sunset,

213
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,769
I can't help but wonder
where it all went wrong.

214
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,969
You've all
disappointed me greatly.

215
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,805
Fanny, a single mama
in the city.

216
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,881
Thank you.

217
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,407
Jeb, a street pusher.

218
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,845
After I left the army,

219
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,527
I bought a 9-acre worm
farm from a Californian.

220
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,482
Turns out "worm" means
something else out there,

221
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,487
and I am now in
the business of

222
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,369
pain management.

223
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,284
Or the smoking of
pain management.

224
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,524
I can't stand the fact
that Jeb is a pot farmer.

225
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,443
He could've
grown anything.

226
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,443
Anything in the world.

227
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,967
He used to talk about growing
a peanut-grape hybrid.

228
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,010
One plant,
one sandwich.

229
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,844
We can't just sit by

230
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,924
and watch
our family farm disappear.

231
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,561
So, here are my terms.
Dwight, Fanny, Jeb,

232
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,966
if you come back home,
I will leave you my farm.

233
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,724
So, there you have it.

234
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,404
Is she crazy?

235
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,891
FANNYI Dwight?
JEBI Dwight? Buddy?

236
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,883
- No, no, no.
- Snap out of it.

237
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,961
JEBI Dwight!

238
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,086
Let's do this. Let's run
Aunt Shirley's farm.

239
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,446
I'm in. Boom!

240
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,885
No, no, no.
I'm not moving back here.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,967
Are you crazy?
Of course you are.

242
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,327
Look, I don't wanna
be mean, or insulting.

243
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,401
I know that
you like it here.

244
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,608
But, Dwight,
it's just that farm life

245
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,321
lacks a certain sort
of sophistication...

246
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,481
Oh, my God.
...that Cammie and I

247
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,250
are drawn to.

248
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,766
I don't know,
the men are just...

249
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,687
It's almost like
there's a willing ignorance.

250
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,561
Yes, I... Thank you
for asking me.

251
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,962
I actually have written a little
bit of poetry. That's crazy.

252
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,481
And I was recently published.

253
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,928
Which is just...
Maybe I have... Yep, I do.

254
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,527
Here it is, from the
hartfordwomens litquarterly.com.

255
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,411
"A Willing ignorance"
by Fanny Schrute.

256
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,524
Totally. Yep.

257
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,367
The people here are like
a fart.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,967
You know what I'm saying?
Like a fart.

259
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,283
You know what? Let's take a
couple of nights and stay here

260
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,089
and think about
Aunt Shirley's offer.

261
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,645
Couple of nights
couldn't hurt.

262
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,370
Somehow I think a couple
of nights could hurt.

263
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,646
You will say yes
on one.

264
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,247
Five, four, three, two...
Get ready to say yes. One!

265
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,084
Yes!
Absolutely!

266
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,964
Growing up with Dwight
and Mose was not easy.

267
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,883
Dwight was obviously the cool
one, and Mose was the visionary,

268
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,520
which left me to
be the comedian.

269
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,721
That doesn't work
on me...

270
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,325
Okay... by the way. It's not...

271
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,765
Very clever. Okay.
Oui!

272
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,762
Oui.
Oh, my goodness.

273
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,481
When we
arrive, sons and daughters

274
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,247
We'll make
our homes on the water

275
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,721
We'll build our...

276
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,282
People underestimate
the power of nostalgia.

277
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,486
If baseball can use it

278
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,688
to get people to care about
that worthless sport,

279
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,401
then I can use it to get my
siblings to care about the farm.

280
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,529
Nostalgia is truly one of
the great human weaknesses.

281
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,568
Second only to the neck.

282
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,647
When we
arrive, sons and daughters

283
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,167
We'll make our
homes on the water

284
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,608
We'll build
our walls aluminum

285
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,447
We'll fill our mouths
with cinnamon now

286
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,370
So, I forgot about
this old custom.

287
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,727
If a man is interested
in courting a woman,

288
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,686
he may throw
the beaks of a crow at her.

289
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,445
And then if she's interested
in accepting the courtship,

290
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,727
she has to destroy the beaks.

291
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,048
When we
arrive, sons and daughters

292
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,283
We'll make our
homes on the water

293
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,087
We'll build
our walls aluminum

294
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,323
We'll fill our mouths
with cinnamon...

295
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,801
Hey, uhm...

296
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,763
I just wanna say
I'm sorry for screwing you.

297
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,161
I'm not sorry
about it.

298
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,241
I am.

299
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,605
It was my rock bottom.

300
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,568
Kevin, you can do this.

301
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,766
You don't know that.

302
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,650
Kevin, let's think of
something to distract us.

303
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,324
Like the movie Skyfall.

304
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,164
You loved the movie
Skyfall, right?

305
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,526
Mmm-hmm.

306
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,284
James Bond was a spy.

307
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,089
Yes, he was a good spy.

308
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,481
Yeah. He was the best.

309
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,126
James Bond would
love this cupcake.

310
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,682
Hey, you know what, it was
great to see you all again.

311
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,361
Take care.

312
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,485
I am going through
a 12-step program.

313
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,768
I'm currently
on step zero,

314
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,322
which is have
a load of fun.

315
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,886
I spent six hours

316
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,129
carefully removing
the frosting

317
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,320
and then layering in a variety
of drugs, some legal, some not,

318
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,483
some laxative,
some constipating.

319
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,527
You don't fire The Packman and
expect to get away with it.

320
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,046
Guys, I'm proud of us.

321
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,971
Ithinkwe did
the right thing. Hey!

322
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,285
What, Pam?
Wait!

323
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,442
He's gone. It's just
a cupcake now.

324
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,046
No, no! It's the
principle of the thing.

325
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,842
Oh, my God. lforgive
him so much.

326
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,924
- Whoa, is he choking?
- Kevin?

327
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,648
That was fantastic.

328
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,122
Is it dangerous to take the
eggs in front of them?

329
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,248
Yes, very. You really
need to stand back.

330
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,526
'Cause these are
killer chickens.

331
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,731
I was just asking you
something I didn't know.

332
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,888
Which is fine,
and you learned something.

333
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,371
But it was kind of
a stupid question,

334
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,010
so you're gonna get
made fun of a little bit.

335
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,644
Are we gonna
eat these today?

336
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,561
If you want.

337
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,325
Is that a guillotine?

338
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,404
This? No.

339
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,767
That'd be cool though.
It's for milking.

340
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,641
That's a cow?

341
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,323
Did you just ask me
if this was a cow?

342
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,884
What are you
doing now?

343
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,563
Come here. Come on.

344
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,968
Grab a teat with each hand.
Sit down.

345
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,361
There you go. Squeeze
from top to bottom.

346
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,841
Really pull, use some muscle.
Draw the milk out.

347
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,246
All right,
going all right?

348
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,771
I don't know.

349
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,090
Well, is the udder hot?
ls the milk clumpy?

350
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,327
I don't know
any of that.

351
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,244
Okay, you suck at this.
Gimme those teats.

352
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,930
Didn't your father
teach you anything?

353
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,924
I never met him.

354
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,602
Good morning, Erin.
Hey.

355
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,763
Hey, everybody. I decided
to eat my cupcake.

356
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,521
I thought about it
last night.

357
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,250
I talked to Jim,
I talked to my sister,

358
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,564
and I think that as long as Todd
Packer doesn't know, it's okay.

359
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,769
I don't care what you do, Pam,
just please stop making noise.

360
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,961
Phyllis!

361
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,485
Packer laced the cupcakes.

362
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,607
No!

363
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,370
Did you get diarrhea
or were you stoned?

364
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,771
Some of us got both.

365
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,081
Oh, my God!
ls everyone okay?

366
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,322
Last night, I got out
all of my old dolls

367
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,562
and played with them
on the living room floor.

368
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,442
Then I ordered 10 American
Girl outfits online.

369
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,841
It was thousands
of dollars.

370
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,486
VVeH, count
yourself lucky, Phyllis.

371
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,210
I got the toilet.

372
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,691
Me too.

373
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,411
I went Christmas caroling,
in March,

374
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,767
and I fertilized some
bushes along the way.

375
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,367
So, not my best night.
But not my worst night.

376
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,928
Oh!
What did you do, Andy?

377
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
Last night! Oh, God.

378
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,284
I don't know. Nothing, really.

379
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,728
Kevin? KEVIN:
Why would you ask me?

380
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,928
I'm not...
I just... I don't know.

381
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,121
No.

382
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,085
Gosh, actually,
it is hard to recall.

383
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,642
Pretty normal night.

384
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,122
My night was just like that.

385
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,931
Yup-
Okay-

386
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,449
Meaning normal.

387
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,083
Yeah, I didn't see
you last night at all.

388
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,209
Nope,
I did not see you either.

389
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,648
Wow! He is officially
the worst human being.

390
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,206
Uh...

391
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,810
But, Kevin, that's...

392
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,049
Yeah, no, I understand, Pam.
I understand.

393
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,560
No. Oh.

394
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,247
So, that's it. I just wanted
to make amends.

395
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,085
That's big of you, man.
Takes a lot of courage.

396
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,407
Ooh.

397
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,481
Red velvet.

398
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,362
I should apologize too.
It's okay.

399
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,608
I'm over it.

400
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,321
This is no
9-acre worm farm.

401
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,970
This is a beast.

402
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,010
Whoever's managing this thing
is gonna have a hell of a job.

403
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,690
Not it.
Not it.

404
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,281
It.

405
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,324
If your kid doesn't put in some farm
time, he's gonna stay like that.

406
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,169
All right, fine.
