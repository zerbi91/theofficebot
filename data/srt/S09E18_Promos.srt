1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,926
Uh-oh.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,246
She's doing it again.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,522
Phyllis has gotten
into audio books.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,081
And lately she's been listening
to Fifty Shades Of Grey,

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,570
which, if you don't know what
it is, it's a book about, um...

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,604
It's porn.
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,445
Seriously?
This is unacceptable.

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,245
It's officially
a hostile work environment.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,367
Why'?

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,045
Somebodyjust needs
to get her attention,

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,804
tell her it's not okay
to do this in public.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,650
Be careful. I pulled
my mom's dog

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,171
off a pillow once,
and I got bit.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,442
Just ignore her. Sooner
or later, she'll finish.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,564
Oh, Meredith! Good lord.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,681
What?

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,000
Phyllis is masturbating.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,282
In the office
right now as we speak.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,244
Can we skip
the color commentary

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,970
and just have Andy go
out there and fire her?

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,841
He can't do that.

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,448
Turns out she's allowed to have
feelings of sexual arousal.

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,764
Doesn't become a violation till
she physically acts on it.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,321
- How do you propose that...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,402
Why is Phyllis so aroused?

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,204
She's listening to
Fifty Shades Of Grey.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,681
Well, there you go.
That's muy caliente.

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,161
Okay, you are useless.
I'll take care of this.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,161
What the hell?

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,049
It's okay, guys.
She's no longer horny.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,891
Excuse me,
dirty birdie.

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,007
What?

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,610
You can have this back
at the end of the day.

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,681
Okay-

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,571
Clark, I need
your advice.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,244
I'm having
some lady troubles.

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,681
What's her name?
Esther Brueger.

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,921
Sweet.

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,282
Lives on the neighboring
farm. 85 acres.

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,686
Yeah. Keep talking.

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,447
Well, we've been out three times.
There has been physicality.

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,806
The thing is,
we were hanging out

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,927
with her father
the other night,

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,570
looking at a farm catalogue,
next thing I know

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,609
he wants to lease
a tractor with me.

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,207
Oh!

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,041
What do you think?

48
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,691
The same thing
that you think.

49
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,050
Long-term tractor leases can put
pressure on a relationship.

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,521
God, a lot of my buddies are going
through the same thing right now.

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,887
Something in the air.

52
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,007
Here you go.

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,044
And good
for you, Dwight.

54
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,645
I'm so glad
you found someone.

55
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,088
I bet she's got
kind eyes.

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,688
Dwight is dating a Brussels
sprout farmer named Esther.

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,491
She's coming here this
afternoon with her father.

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,131
Who knows? Maybe she'll be
pulling the horse cart.

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,926
Cece has been calling me Pamela.
Like, four times this week.

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,121
Oh, man!

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,965
I wonder if she'll
start calling you Jim.

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,486
Oh, boy!
Please don't.

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,601
I know.

64
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,729
Let's not
let that happen.

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,086
Um...

66
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,287
What was I gonna...
What was I gonna say?

67
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,686
You know,
your assistant told me

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,001
that you have a big
pitch meeting today.

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,601
With Ryan Howard.
How did that happen?

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,844
Not that Ryan Howard.
The Phillies' first baseman.

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,769
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,921
Exactly.

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,121
Oh.

74
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,407
Um...

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,766
Okay. Well...

76
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,811
Yeah. So, I'll talk
to you later?

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,650
Yeah, sounds good. Okay.
Yup. Okay, great.

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,081
Bye.
Bye.

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,970
What's going on? Did Gangnam
Style put out a new song?

80
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,289
There's a promo for the
documentary on the web.

81
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,165
Play it again.

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,401
The boss.

83
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,681
There's Michael.

84
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,841
The workers.

85
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,361
The lives.

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,281
The loves.

87
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,961
The people.

88
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,721
The paper.

89
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,846
The Office:
An American Workplace.

90
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,762
Coming soon on WVIA.

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,963
You go to the bathroom for 45
minutes, and everything changes.

92
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,529
This is a documentary?

93
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,921
Oh!

94
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,120
I always thought we were, like,
specimens in a human zoo.

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,801
Did you see this?

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,528
Your screen is all black. You
just unplugged your computer.

97
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,286
Oh, my God. Is that you and Jim?
Uh-huh.

98
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,846
Jeez!

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,363
You fell in love
with that hair? Really?

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,847
Yikes!

101
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,244
That is awful.

102
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,520
It wasn't so bad.

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,404
Guys, are you reading
the online comments?

104
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,524
Somebody commented
on my banjo playing.

105
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,921
"Banjo at 0:19 is a'ight."
Internet, calm down!

106
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,243
I must have really
connected with this guy.

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,767
I mean, that's a guy's name, right?
Chobblegobbler?

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,251
Hey, man, how you doing?
Jim Halpert.

109
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,685
Nice to meet you.
Eat fresh.

110
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,887
Hey, man. Darryl.

111
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,007
Hey, man. Ryan.
Nice to meet you.

112
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,082
Eat fresh. Eat fresh.

113
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,327
Let's go to
the conference room.

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,969
Esther's on her way up.
I wonder if she wants a snack.

115
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,762
Let me see. I know she
likes apples and carrots.

116
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,680
I bet she does.

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,446
I bet she'll eat 'em right out of your
hand with those big, strong teeth.

118
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,606
Did I tell you
about her teeth?

119
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,845
Hey, Dwight,
you have some guests.

120
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,167
I think they're from the forest
where we harvest our paper.

121
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,361
Yes.

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,327
Ah!

123
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,845
The Brueger family. Welcome.

124
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,441
Fine office you have here.
Sturdy walls.

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,282
Yes. Esther. You look
radiant as always.

126
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,481
Thank you.

127
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,367
I guess men find
Esther attractive.

128
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,603
I mean, if there are
chubby chasers,

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,650
then there are men
that like that thing.

130
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,888
Weird to see how we used
to look in those promos.

131
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,484
Some of us have
changed so much.

132
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,769
We've all changed.

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,569
With our firm,
you'll be building equity

134
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,529
for long after they
retire your number.

135
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,167
And we all know baseball
does not last forever.

136
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,243
I look at these actors
on TV, and I think,

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,163
"Come on. I can do that."

138
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,321
Right?

139
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,847
Watch this. Eat fresh.

140
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,806
Now, what does that
make you think of?

141
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,891
Subway sandwiches.
Yeah.

142
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,440
How? I didn't say,
"Subway sandwiches."

143
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,965
It's called
playing the subtext.

144
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,121
Wow.

145
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,440
I actually wrote
a screenplay.

146
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,329
It's called The Big Piece.

147
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,722
Based on his nickname.
I like it already.

148
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,330
Let me guess,
it's autobiographical.

149
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,131
Half biopic,
half superhero movie.

150
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,288
The mild-mannered
professional baseball player

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,771
Ryan Howard
hits a home run...

152
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,080
Okay.
...into outer space.

153
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,203
Ball comes back
with space dust on it,

154
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,683
which transforms him
into the Big Piece.

155
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,689
Big Piece. The
space dust doesit

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,881
Space dust.
Okay.

157
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,281
I actually brought
some copies of my script,

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,725
if you guys want
to read it together.

159
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,044
Sure, yeah. Hollywood.

160
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,763
All right. Yeah,
we're gonna read it.

161
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,881
Okay, great.

162
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,089
Andy, are there
documentary groupies?

163
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,645
Of course there are.

164
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,721
Of course.

165
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,890
A little ironic that I'm
gonna be kind of a TV star,

166
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,327
because my last
Chad Flenderman novel

167
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,961
was based on
a murdered TV star.

168
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,083
The Small Scream.
I don't care.

169
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,442
Hey, guys, I just
found another promo.

170
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,242
- It's in Danish.
- Danish?

171
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,925
I guess it's gonna start
airing in Denmark.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,001
Oh, my God.

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,320
What was that
word they said

174
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,243
when they showed me?
Skrald mand?

175
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,086
What's that mean
in Danish?

176
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,011
IICOOI guy“?

177
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,127
"Dumpster man."

178
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,090
Cool. Superhero.

179
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,285
What about me'?
Cloken tre pige.

180
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,522
Tre pige. "3:00 p.m. girl."

181
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,205
What? Why would they...
Wait a second. Wait a second.

182
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,361
What was that?

183
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,164
I didn't know
they were filming then.

184
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,251
It looks like the cameraman was
hiding behind the shelves.

185
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,329
Wait, so they were
filming all the time,

186
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,765
even when we didn't
know it?

187
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,291
Oh, my God.

188
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,449
There is much more secret
filming than I expected.

189
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,688
But I am fine with it,
I mean it. lam.

190
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,922
Are you kidding me? It's like
half the show is secret footage.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,650
I am a very
private person.

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,609
I show 'em when I
want to show 'em.

193
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,801
Who wants a taste?

194
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,565
Boob sauce!
Meredith!

195
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,966
Oh, my God. Do they film us
at night when we're sleeping?

196
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,242
Yes, Erin. They film us at
night when we're sleeping

197
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,321
'cause that
makes great TV.

198
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,244
Hey. Oscar.

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,324
I'm sorry, sweetie. This whole
thing is just freaking me out.

200
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,244
I have been very
honest with you guys,

201
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,890
in a way that could
seriously impact

202
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,725
the political career of a
very good friend of mine.

203
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,320
You're not gonna use
any of that, are you?

204
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,369
People, relax.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,764
We are killing it online.

206
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,080
Have you guys
checked the comments?

207
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,045
Smokethatskinwagon says,
"You guys are killing it."

208
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,290
I mean, we're Internet
sensations, guys.

209
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,569
I think we need to figure
out what's going on.

210
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,448
I mightjust
take a little walk.

211
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,969
Yes, a little walk
sounds like a good idea.

212
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,041
Okay-

213
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,325
Okay, everyone,
turn off your mikes.

214
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,801
We need to know more.
Did those shots have sound?

215
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,609
What exactly did
they get on tape?

216
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,927
Isneezed into my hands
without using Purell

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,126
and then dipped
into the candyjar.

218
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,201
Did they film that?

219
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,800
My first week here, I sneezed
directly into the candyjar

220
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,645
becauselthought I'd get more
screen time as a villain.

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,968
Okay, Pam, why don't
you visit your buddy,

222
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,929
the crew guy that got fired,
find out what they got?

223
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,127
- Bflan?
- Yeah

224
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,607
Yeah, I guess I could.

225
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,883
Hurry, Pam. I need to know how much
hellfire is gonna rain down on me.

226
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,810
I thought Teri
knew about Cynthia.

227
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,167
She does, but neither of
them know about Lydia.

228
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,726
Oh.

229
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,527
Whoa!

230
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,369
Okay, so what's
this lever do?

231
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,250
That manipulates
the secondary shaft.

232
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,648
The secondary shaft.
Mmm-hmm.

233
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,968
The lift capacity's up to 2,000 pounds.
That's a lot of beets.

234
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,526
Let's talk terms.

235
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,969
If you agree to a 40:60
split on this tractor,

236
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,806
I'll store it in
one of my barns.

237
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,726
Mr. Brueger, are you trying
to take advantage of me

238
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,086
because I'm interested
in your daughter?

239
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,521
50:50 split,
or no deal.

240
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,810
Esther, get in the truck.

241
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,321
No, wait, okay, wait.

242
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,201
You win.

243
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,807
Let's get
the paperwork started.

244
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,285
We should buy
an auger together.

245
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,561
Oh.

246
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,924
Yeah. Yeah,
we should do that.

247
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,202
You would be a great one
to buy an auger with.

248
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,683
Hello, honey, I just spoke
to the TV repairman,

249
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,207
and he says we need to
keep our TVs turned off

250
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,406
for a couple
of months.

251
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,971
Something about
the wiring.

252
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,690
Oh! Seven new comments.
"The guy at 0:19 is hawt."

253
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,442
"Hi, bongripper, it's me,
Andy, the guy from 0:19.

254
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,046
"I'm glad that you enjoyed
my work in that promo.

255
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,248
"I really enjoyed
your comment.

256
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,682
"Going to read some more comments now.
Have a great day!"

257
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,688
"He's not hawt.
He's gay."

258
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,043
"Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy.
Nice name. Not!

259
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,482
"Guess what? I'm not gay.
So, you're an idiot.

260
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,845
"And I am hawt, according to people
on this site who have a brain.

261
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,804
"Never comment on
this page ever again."

262
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,289
"He is hawt." See? Thank you.
That's more like it.

263
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,085
"He is butt."

264
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,846
Damn it!

265
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,800
I'm about to lose
my freaking mind!

266
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,202
Screw you, TexasPoonTappa.

267
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,841
Oh.

268
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,124
Security deposit.
That's been...

269
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,044
Standard.
Right. Standard.

270
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,528
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
Not now.

271
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,880
Just one second.
No. No.

272
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,046
I'm closing a deal on a
tractor with the father

273
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,724
of a woman
I plan to inseminate.

274
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,081
Don't do it.
What?

275
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,647
Don't you cap
that pen.

276
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,165
Do not cap
that pen! Do not!

277
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,321
You capped it!

278
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,967
Wow. You are serious. Okay,
you've got two minutes.

279
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,041
Then the cap comes off.

280
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,486
Dude, we're
being conned.

281
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,121
Go on.

282
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,164
These chicks are way
too hot to be into us.

283
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,609
Esther's just pretending
to like you,

284
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,609
so that you'll buy her
daddy a new tractor.

285
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,161
No.

286
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,645
Yeah, the sister's
trying to seduce me

287
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,960
into buying
an auger with her.

288
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,726
What? Has the warranty expired
on the auger you have now?

289
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,604
I don't even know
what an auger is.

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,324
No woman would
ever want a man

291
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,925
who doesn't know
what an auger is.

292
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,764
Hey. You ready to sign?

293
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,451
I just need a moment
to consider your offer.

294
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,405
Excuse me.

295
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,405
Oh, hey.
Hey.

296
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,040
Hi.
Hi.

297
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,011
I'm sorry. Do you have a minute?
Is this a bad time?

298
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,684
No, no. Please, yeah.
Come on in.

299
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,926
Good to see you. Sorry. My
place is usually not this...

300
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,611
Oh, my gosh,
please, don't.

301
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,003
Actually, it's always
like this.

302
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,248
You want to go outside? It's a
little less cluttered out there.

303
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,964
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah?

304
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,284
Let me grab a couple drinks.
Okay.

305
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,363
Wow. You have
a nice view.

306
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,441
All right.

307
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,043
That's for you.
Thank you.

308
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,161
Cheers.
Cheers.

309
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,686
All right. How much have
you revealed on camera

310
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,171
about your relationship
with the Senator?

311
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,484
They caught us
kissing on Halloween.

312
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,608
He was dressed
like Ronald Reagan!

313
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,121
God.
Ow! Angela!

314
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,522
Well, he kissed
like Jack Kennedy. Oh.

315
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,329
Stop it.
Stop kissing him.

316
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,286
Someone needs to call and warn him.
This could ruin his career.

317
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,610
Idon%Hke
giving him bad news.

318
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,881
Call him!
You call him!

319
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,565
Call him! Call him!
Stop hitting me! No!

320
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,449
So...
So...

321
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,404
What brings you by?

322
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,160
Well, the promo for the
documentary aired today.

323
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,651
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.

324
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,251
It's kind of crazy. It is.

325
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,731
See all this,
like, old stuff.

326
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,847
I know.

327
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,565
There's that shot of Jim
and I up on the roof.

328
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,211
Yeah, that was
a good moment.

329
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,447
Yeah, wasn't that neat?

330
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,760
Yeah, that was cool.

331
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,841
Yeah.

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,082
And there's this one
when we were listening

333
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,009
to music,
and it's like,

334
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,561
it's like
we were in love,

335
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,325
we didn't even know
we were in love.

336
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,051
But do you think
Jim's changed?

337
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,641
Um...

338
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,768
I'm sorry. Did that... But
that was out of the blue.

339
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,291
I just mean,
because you know us,

340
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,966
and you've observed
us for 10 years,

341
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,202
and I feel like he's...

342
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,284
I just feel like he's so into
his work right now, and...

343
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,211
I don't know.
Am I crazy?

344
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,448
No, you're not crazy.

345
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,005
Well, I wish
that made me feel better.

346
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,969
Listen, so, everybody
saw the promos,

347
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,405
and they're kind
of freaking out.

348
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,164
'Cause it seems like you got a
lot of private stuff on camera.

349
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,241
Yeah.

350
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,330
Stuff people didn't intend
for everyone to see,

351
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,402
and they kind of
want to know how much.

352
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,161
They want to know
how much what?

353
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,050
How much stuff you got.

354
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,241
Pretty much everything.

355
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,087
Well, yeah, but what if we
turn off our mike packs?

356
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,211
They've got parabolic mikes. They
can pick you up 100 yards away.

357
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,569
So, no, if you were
around there, they got you.

358
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,889
So, we basically had no
privacy for 10 years.

359
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,450
That's not really true.
I mean...

360
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,441
Um...

361
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,726
Yeah, I gotta go.

362
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,729
No, hang on a second.
Pam, I'm sorry.

363
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,041
I can explain this
so much better.

364
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,282
No, I think
you explained it.

365
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,410
Look, if you give me
a chance, I can... Pam...

366
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,203
"Together we will win
this baseball game

367
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,886
"against the Evil
Space Yankees. Eat fresh."

368
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,089
That'll pay for
the exploding helicopter.

369
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,281
Smart.
Mmm-hmm.

370
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,044
"Suddenly, the evil thugs
break into the stadium.

371
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,805
"The Big Piece hits baseballs
at the evil thugs."

372
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,690
"Buy me some peanuts
and crackerjacks."

373
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,450
Come on, man. Sell it.

374
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,485
Yeah, Jim.

375
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,083
"Buy me some peanuts
and crackerjacks!"

376
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,286
Yeah, that's better.

377
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,406
"A bunch of hot women
go, 'Oh, yeah!"'

378
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,850
"Megan, I was too shy
to tell you this

379
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,446
"when I was just a normal
professional baseball player,

380
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,170
"but I love you."

381
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,888
"They kiss. It is super emotional.
Like in Toy Story."

382
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,081
Wow.

383
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,003
I tell you what.
It's really strong.

384
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,202
Can't wait to read the rest
of it later, see how it ends.

385
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,401
It's so strong.

386
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,481
Keep reading then.

387
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,849
"Gotta go. Darth Vader's
launching a huge attack."

388
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,367
Um, another thing.
I'm gonna need you

389
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,807
to get me the rights
to Darth Vader.

390
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,489
I don't know how we'd go
about doing that, but...

391
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,643
We can look into it.
We'll look into it.

392
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,161
We need Darth.

393
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,241
We gotta get him.
Go after Darth then.

394
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,487
We're gonna go get him.

395
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,561
That's what
we're gonna do.

396
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,130
We're gonna go
get him.

397
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,521
Maybe you're right.
Esther's a 10,

398
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,204
and the best I've
ever done is Angela,

399
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,163
who's a nine,
and she rejected me.

400
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,886
A Scranton nine,
but, yeah, point taken.

401
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,007
Hey, let's go out tonight and just
score a couple of fours, huh?

402
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,324
I mean, there are
no games with fours.

403
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,129
Who needs a new
tractor anyway?

404
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,523
Maybe we're the kind of guys
who end up with a tractor

405
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,967
that's already been rode
hard and put away muddy.

406
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,043
Screw new tractors.
Guys like us,

407
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,521
we got to plant
our seed a different way.

408
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,841
By hand.

409
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,441
Dwight. We need to talk.

410
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,167
I don't know that
there's anything

411
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,605
left for us to
talk about, Esther.

412
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,725
Look, we're gonna
have the tractor

413
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,131
for the same amount
of work days,

414
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,640
but my dad is planning
on leasing it

415
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,324
to the Vanderkirk
brothers on the weekends.

416
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,641
No.

417
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,085
So, you're gonna be
paying more,

418
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,525
but he's putting on
10 times the miles,

419
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,965
and he's pocketing
a profit behind your back.

420
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,241
Thatsnake!

421
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,448
You need to tell him you
want a deal based on miles,

422
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,608
or he can just stick that tractor
where the sun don't shine.

423
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,411
That shady grove
out by Willard's Pond.

424
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,324
So, you're fine with me
not leasing the tractor?

425
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,323
I mean, our courtship can proceed?
Of course.

426
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,288
You didn't think I was just
tractor bait, did you?

427
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,241
No.

428
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,281
Yeah.

429
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,727
Hey, Dwight.
What's an auger used for?

430
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,520
Post hole digging.

431
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,204
You've reached Senator
Robert Lipton. Please leave a message.

432
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,561
', honey.

433
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,641
Go. No, go ahead.
No, you go.

434
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,688
Hi, honey.
Hey, Robert.

435
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,604
It's Angela and Oscar.
Hey.

436
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,091
Just a few quick things.

437
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,080
The documentary's going
to be airing soon,

438
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,128
and you look great
in the promos.

439
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,968
You look so handsome.
Very presidential.

440
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,162
Very much so. Absolutely. Yeah.

441
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,681
Hey, I get the sense you're
gonna be outed as gay.

442
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,406
Yes, and I cheated
on you with Dwight.

443
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,047
It looks like they got it on film.
I didn't tell you about it.

444
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,044
I think that's it.
I think we're good.

445
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,088
Done. Okay.
Bye. Love you.

446
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,566
Hey, TexasPoonTappa
and JasonJasonJason

447
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,882
and all the rest of you haters
out there, check this out.

448
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,761
Good night, Andy.

449
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,041
Yeah. See ya.

450
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,361
Oh!

451
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,211
What?

452
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,805
I hope you got sound on everything.
I'd love a DVD of that.
