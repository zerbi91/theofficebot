1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,690
Oh. Hey, champions.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,966
Good morning.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,566
Quarter finals in an hour,
hope you got some sleep,

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,881
because I'm going to be haunting
your nightmares tonight.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,208
I did. I got some
really good sleep.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,281
Did you?

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,087
Zzz...

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,963
Yesterday was the first round of a
branch-wide paper airplane contest.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,208
It was being sponsored
by WeyerHammer Paper

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,851
in an effort to get us to sell
more of their new product,

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,925
Airstream Deluxe A4,
the Cadillac of paper.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,282
It's not so easy on the environment,
if you know what I mean.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,806
It's practically
made of plastic.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,122
We started with
16 brave aviators.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,166
Some used skill.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,802
Others relied on showmanship.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,086
Others seemed
not to comprehend

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,650
- what a paper airplane is.
- Oh!

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,563
And of course there was the odd
moment of heartbreak and disaster.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,642
I think I left my glasses
down here somewhere.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,410
Crossing through.
Beep, beep.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,841
Ow! Ow!

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,287
I didn't see you! You should
have yelling "crossing!"

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,691
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,247
Okay, so is that my spot?

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,766
We are now down
to an elite eight.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,004
Well, seven, and Toby.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,771
"Be careful of that beaker.
It contains dangerous acid!"

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,004
it does not say "dangerous" and
there's no exclamation point.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,243
Well, I'm just... I'm trying
to bring some life to it.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,286
Last week I got an agent, and
uh, this week I got a movie.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,968
HRPDC Chemical
Handling Protocols.

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,048
It's going to be seen
by tons of workers

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,168
in the industrial
chemical community,

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,765
one of whom
could have a cousin

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,208
whose brother is Brad Pitt,
and then boom!

37
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,324
Next thing you know,
I'm in Moneyballs 2.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,528
Andy? Go away! We're
running lines.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,530
You wanted to
see the gooey eye.

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,922
Oh, yeah.
All right, get over here.

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,841
I'm so freaked out by things
going into eyes. ltjust... Wow.

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,203
Oh, ugh!

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,244
I can't even... I'm so freaked
out by that. Just go.

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,283
Go, go, go. All right.
It's getting gooier.

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,203
So, we'll just do it later.
Okay.

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,210
All right, where were we?

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,881
We stopped
at "full of acid."

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,121
"And remember, do not attempt to
extinguish a chemical fire with water.

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,727
"It will only exacerbate the flame.
The dangerous flame."

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,002
That was great, man.
All right, I'm out of here.

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,287
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
Don't go anywhere.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,727
I just need to
find more colors.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,487
Let's do it
six more times.

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,566
Hey, I just wanted to say that
you woke up early with the kids

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,766
and let me sleep.

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,605
And I really appreciate that.

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,091
Thank you.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,767
I appreciate that
you appreciate that.

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,201
So, we had
couples therapy.

60
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,408
No shame in that. Get
it all out in the open.

61
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,891
And we have homework.
Yes.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,530
We are supposed to
look for every chance

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,047
to acknowledge and appreciate
each other's sacrifices.

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,602
Because I need to appreciate what
Pam's been doing to run the house

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,761
While I'm in Philly.

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,400
And we are also supposed to
speak our truths. Mmm-hmm.

67
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,881
Becauseiflhad
spoken my truth earlier

68
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,962
about not wanting
to move to Philly,

69
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,405
then maybe we
wouldn't have had

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,323
this opportunity
for couples therapy.

71
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,640
Oh, we're supposed
to call everything

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,927
we don't want to
do "opportunities."

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,800
Heads up, everyone!

74
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,204
If you really need something from me
today, let's get it done tomorrow.

75
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,965
Carla Fern got me a gig.

76
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,531
Hey.
Yeah.

77
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,726
Who's Carla Fern?

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,531
Who is Carla Fern?
Well...

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,921
Wow.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,810
Uh, she's my agent
and my drill sergeant.

81
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,484
And one
of my best friends.

82
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,928
Oh, and, Oscar,
I already figured out

83
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,565
if I have to get
emotional in the film,

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,483
I'm just gonna think about you
getting dumped by the Senator.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,241
Why don't you use your own life?
Erin just dumped you.

86
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,571
It's a little raw.
Not cool, Oscar.

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,926
But you just...
Not cool.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,162
Okay. Day two.

89
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,687
Drama in
the warehouse skies.

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,730
This is Robert
from WeyerHammer Paper

91
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,606
who will be joining us
to judge the final rounds.

92
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,170
Who's pumped for
the quarterfinals, huh?

93
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,480
I'm pumped.

94
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,449
- Clark's a dead man.
- All right.

95
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,966
Sounds like somebody wants
to walk away with this.

96
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,769
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

97
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,328
Nellie, you didn't tell
us we could win money.

98
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,722
Oh, yes, I did.
I told you all.

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,089
It was, um... 'Cause that's an awful
lot of money for me to forget.

100
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,528
Not one of us remembers you
saying anything about $2,000.

101
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,041
I forgot.
I completely forgot.

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,644
But at least now that
large piece of cardboard

103
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,364
that man was carrying around
makes sense.

104
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,728
Nellie, this is a competition.
Please take it seriously.

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,165
Oh, please.

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,568
Me? Oh, I'm fine.

107
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,481
I mean, sure, times are leaner now
that I'm separated from the Senator.

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,847
But my new studio apartment...

109
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,969
...is just fine
for me and Phillip

110
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,603
and Tinkie and Crinklepuss and
Bandit Two and Pawlick Baggins

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,411
and Lady Aragorn
and their 10 kittens.

112
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,168
Oh, my God. Come here.
Come here, let's go.

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,210
I had a chance with Dwight,
but I didn't take it.

114
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,167
And if I went back now, when I'm
broke and he just inherited a farm,

115
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,609
I'd be one of those
gold-digging tramps

116
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,724
you read about that
try to bag a farmer.

117
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,245
I offered myself to Angela,
and she turned me down.

118
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,641
If she changes her mind,
the next move is hers.

119
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,888
I'm with Esther now,
she's younger than Angela.

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,045
Sturdier, more comfortable with
the scent of a manured field.

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,883
Let's be honest, when it
came to manured fields,

122
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,281
Angela was,
at best, indifferent.

123
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,606
Oh, wide wings,
interesting.

124
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,125
Hey! Why don't you back off?

125
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,401
I mean, best of luck
to you in the competition.

126
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,201
Growing up in an orphanage, you have
to fight other kids for everything.

127
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,965
Snacks, pillows, parents.

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,371
I'm kind of worried about
Pete seeing that side of me.

129
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,728
I once ripped Greedy Susan's
pigtail right off her head

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,643
just for a handful of Crispix.

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,488
Are you in that paper
documentary, too? Yup.

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,043
You need an agent?
No.

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,930
I mean, you never
acted in anything before.

134
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,403
He's just my entourage.

135
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,444
I was in The Wiz
in high school.

136
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,008
That's the clicky-clacker.

137
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,164
He clicks that, and then
the guy says, "Action."

138
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,488
Hey, I made 'em
get you a chair.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,401
All my clients sit.

140
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,247
Can I take your picture?

141
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,330
I guess it's starting.

142
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,401
Um...

143
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,848
Yeah. Of course.
Yeah, sure.

144
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,691
Tell you what. I'll put my arm
around you, and then I can take it.

145
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,171
We just need a picture
of the top of your head

146
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,686
in case we burn
some of your hair off.

147
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,327
Got it.

148
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,961
Sorry.

149
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,364
No, if you just keep it down until...

150
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,441
Okay-

151
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,571
Okay, next up we have two
creatures, great and small.

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,570
Kevin versus Angela.

153
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,841
Yes.

154
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,969
Hey, that is a really nice plane.
You make that yourself?

155
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,807
Uh-huh.

156
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,043
Well, what am I thinking? Of
course you made that yourself,

157
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,282
'cause it's in the rules

158
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,727
that you have to
fold your own plane.

159
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,931
Of course.

160
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,609
Kevin, did you
make that yourself?

161
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,121
Yes. In a way.

162
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,245
From one that I
bought on Craigslist.

163
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,408
Oh, man.
I call for a refold.

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,527
No.

165
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,765
Really?
You can't do that.

166
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,080
Thank you.

167
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,846
This is flatter.

168
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,605
It's a piece of paper.
You fold it into an airplane.

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,363
Okay, that's enough. This
is the end of the ream now.

170
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,521
You have to pick one.

171
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,683
I can't. I love them
all too much.

172
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,925
And none of them fly.
So that makes it harder.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,968
You have to choose one now.

174
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,401
Fine.

175
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,603
Angela advances.
Nice.

176
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,721
Whoo!

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,848
Was Dwight rooting for me?

178
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,921
Hmm.

179
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,244
I hadn't noticed.

180
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,331
I'm not giving up.

181
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,768
I am gonna keep making planes
until one of 'em flies.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,527
Like Wilbur and
Orville Redenbacher.

183
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,521
An Earl Grey tea
for the lady.

184
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,089
Oh, thank you. Um...

185
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,003
I acknowledge and appreciate that you
went out of your way to get me tea.

186
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,971
Thank you.
I like being appreciated.

187
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,805
But, to speak my truth,
it wasn't out of the way,

188
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,087
because I felt like
a tea anyway, so one trip.

189
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,128
Well, to speak my truth,

190
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,365
I switched to coffee
in March.

191
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,121
There's a new
espresso machine.

192
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,723
But I still acknowledge
and appreciate the gesture.

193
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,366
We are rolling,
and action.

194
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,651
This video is to demonstrate the
HPRDC Chemical Handling Protocols.

195
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,647
These protocols could save you
from severe injury, even death.

196
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,091
Okay, um, stop.

197
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,128
Um, why are you smiling?

198
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,249
I just made a character
choice to be a scientist

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,802
who really likes what he
does and enjoys his job.

200
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,246
Okay, well, maybe no
smiling on this one.

201
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,651
So how do you want...
How should I do it?

202
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,371
I don't know. Just like you're
reporting the news or something.

203
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,805
Yeah.
Okay? Action.

204
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,962
This video is to demonstrate

205
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,130
the HPRDC Chemical
Handling Protocols.

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,407
It's Tom Brokaw,
the newscaster. Come on.

207
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,050
- Who was that?
- Tom Brokaw.

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,041
Come on, Clark!

209
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,201
Whoa!

210
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,568
Yeah! Oh, eat it, piggy! Eat it!

211
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,727
Oink, oink, oink.

212
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,928
We still got to work together,
so we should keep it civil.

213
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,282
I can't hear what you said.

214
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,010
You get your slop?

215
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,242
All right, you know what, this
is completely unnecessary.

216
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,321
You already won.
Just stop.

217
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,401
Erin. Erin.

218
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,130
What?
Relax.

219
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,929
Next up we have
Dwight and Phyllis.

220
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,725
You can do it, baby.

221
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,211
No, you can't, baby.

222
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,044
You're gonna choke.

223
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,006
Watch and learn.

224
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,442
Dwight defeats Phyllis. Dwight, you
are through to the semifinals.

225
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,204
Yes.
All right.

226
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,851
Oh, Esther,
what are you...

227
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,331
Hey-

228
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,446
You're here early.

229
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,965
Yeah, I plucked
the chickens extra fast,

230
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,405
'cause I knew I was
seeing you tonight.

231
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,960
So, there mightjust be a little
bit of feather in your nuggets

232
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,168
or just a little bit of
meat inside of your pillow.

233
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,885
I like a little
feather in my nuggets.

234
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,286
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

235
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,011
we are now down
to the final four.

236
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,287
Dwight, Erin, Angela,

237
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,650
and God only
knows how, but Toby.

238
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,931
One of you will
walk away with $2,000.

239
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,641
Yeah!

240
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,731
Okay, here you have just
knocked over the beaker.

241
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,609
The chemicals splashed
in your eye.

242
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,523
Which is insanely painful.
Yeah.

243
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,683
And I've already picked a few
childhood memories to tap into

244
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,841
to really express that pain.

245
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,921
That's great.

246
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,366
So what you're gonna do then is come
over here to the eye washing station

247
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,044
and then just kind of
flush out your eyes,

248
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
you know, get the
chemicals out, all right?

249
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,246
So I just lean over
this thing and then

250
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,766
you'll add the water
special effect later?

251
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,645
What water special effect?

252
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,610
Yeah, just hold your
lids open with one hand

253
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,808
and let the stream
bathe your eyeballs.

254
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,811
Like that.

255
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,287
I'm not comfortable
doing my own stunts.

256
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,930
I'll get nude if
you want me to.

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,321
I'll go full Lena Dunham,
but I...

258
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,050
Dude, we don't need
you to go nude, okay?

259
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,201
Absolutely not.

260
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,442
Justdo the eyewash thing, okay?
That's all we're asking here.

261
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,851
Darryl, what do I do?

262
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,410
Hold up, I'm looking at my
spit in the microscope.

263
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,450
They want me to use real
water in the eyewash scene.

264
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,891
So? I can't squirt
stuff in my eyeball.

265
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,564
I've never even
used an eyedropper.

266
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,041
So, Andy, you saw how
to use this?

267
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,329
You step on the pedal.
Water squirts in your eyes.

268
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,686
Carla!

269
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,001
Carla!

270
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,731
It is time for
a little T and A.

271
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,127
I give you Toby and Angela.

272
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,568
- On, my God!
- Whoa!

273
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,681
Oh, my God.
Okay, it's your turn.

274
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,205
Well, Angela is the winner.

275
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,281
Yes.

276
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,887
Is there a reason that we're
excited for that little woman?

277
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,446
Yes, I pity her.

278
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,131
She was recently
in a situation

279
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,726
where she could
have had it all,

280
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,724
and instead she
lost everything.

281
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,968
Mmm. Is she a gambler?

282
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,806
In a way, but not in a stand-up-and-cheer
kind of way, like the song.

283
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,291
Mmm.

284
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,765
That is sad.

285
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,481
Andy, if you don't stick
your eyes in that machine,

286
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,401
I'm gonna call every production
in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

287
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,724
You won't even make an
appearance on a security camera!

288
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,609
What's the holdup here?

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,650
The actor's crying.

290
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,404
Oh, God.

291
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,284
She yelled at me.

292
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,402
I can't wash my eyeball.
I can't do that. I can't.

293
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,763
Andy Bernard can't
squirt water in his eye

294
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,126
and act like it
doesn't freak him out.

295
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,881
But you know who can?

296
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,046
Older Male Lab
Assistant Number One.

297
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,130
Do you believe in me?

298
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,840
Ibeheveu.

299
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,205
I want to go home.

300
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,410
Yeah! Okay. Beat that.

301
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,090
Whoo!

302
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,122
Okay.
Damn it!

303
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,610
Damn it! God...

304
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,723
Sorry. Yeah,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

305
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,926
Okay.
I got mad.

306
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,724
Yeah. 'Cause I don't
like losing, Pete.

307
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,883
I'm just gonna... Sorry, I'm mad, Pete.
I'm mad. I'm really mad.

308
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,564
I wanted to win. We were
gonna win a lot of money.

309
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,688
I was gonna buy you a sweater.
So this is stupid.

310
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,411
It's just the whole contest is stupid.
So it feels...

311
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,447
Oh!

312
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,851
Sorry, I'm mad.
Okay.

313
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,161
I don't like losing.
I thought I was going to win.

314
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,089
Okay, hey, hey, hey-

315
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,764
Sorry. Sorry.

316
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,365
I'm gonna go
upstairs and just...

317
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,087
Oh, I made us a date to
take my mom out to dinner

318
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,605
to thank her for all
that extra babysitting.

319
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,362
Well, you know how much I
appreciate the opportunity

320
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,646
to hang out
with your mom more,

321
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,091
so let me just put
this in my calendar.

322
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,931
I acknowledge
with gratitude

323
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,843
that you are being kind
and responsible enough

324
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,803
to include it in your calendar.

325
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,928
Thank you.
Your mom is a treasure.

326
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,446
Well, I appreciate
that some opportunities...

327
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,641
...can be unpleasant...

328
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,767
Sorry, it's work. Hold.

329
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,207
Hey, Wade, did Cole
Hamels call back or what?

330
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,571
Great. Good.

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,048
Uh, to speak my truth, I'd
appreciate it if you hung that up,

332
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,406
'cause we were in the
middle of a conversation.

333
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,202
I appreciate the sacrifice.

334
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,525
Okay, to speak my truth,
that was a little sarcastic.

335
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,489
I think that's
a little unfair.

336
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,766
Really?

337
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,850
I've been putting the kids to bed
by myself every night for months.

338
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,088
And you had to
miss one phone call.

339
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,003
Is that your truth, Jim?
That's really your truth?

340
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,241
I guess I will
swallow my truth.

341
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,889
Are you guys high?

342
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,804
Because, if so,
to speak my truth,

343
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,248
I would appreciate
the sacrifice of including me

344
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,163
in some hits
off your kind buds.

345
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,005
We're not high.

346
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,768
I wish we'd started this
exercise six months ago.

347
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,047
My heartjust feels so...

348
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,245
Blocked up.

349
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,089
The Mark 47 is
ready for launch.

350
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,681
Less paste.

351
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,650
Here we go. Rolling and action.

352
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
And cut.

353
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,689
We can fix the sound in post.
Yeah.

354
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,081
I can do a better one.

355
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,207
That's fine.
We'll move on.

356
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,765
I said I can do
a better one.

357
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,327
Darryl.

358
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,401
Action.

359
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,205
Kid can act.

360
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,404
Yeah. Yeah.

361
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,965
Each contestant will
throw two airplanes.

362
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,769
After you.
Thank you.

363
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,966
Oh, God.

364
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,725
Angela's first throw,
terrible.

365
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,687
NELLIEI Dwight.

366
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,961
Oh!

367
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,640
Oh, man! It slipped out of my hand.
What a whiff.

368
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,168
Oh,
how'd that happen? God.

369
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,925
We want you to win. Dwight
told me about your situation.

370
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,644
It's such a pity.

371
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,649
Just use the money wisely.

372
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,166
Okay?

373
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,006
Okay-

374
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,371
All right.

375
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,002
Don't you dare tank this.

376
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,201
And we have a winner.
And it's Dwight.

377
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,045
And it is everyone,
because this is over.

378
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,086
Two grand, huh?

379
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,324
I know a guy who can
turn that into $800.

380
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,811
Hint, it's me.

381
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,005
VVeH, lguess you needed the
money more than me, huh?

382
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,570
Use it wisely.

383
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,128
I was
disappointed in Dwight today.

384
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,168
He showed a weakness
that was unbecoming.

385
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,727
Even if he did do it for me.

386
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,164
I don't need pity,
and I don't need charity.

387
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,962
I have my dignity,
and that's enough.

388
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,646
And as long as I
have that, I'll be okay.

389
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,328
I know this was really weird
and it was really hard.

390
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,441
But I think we're
making progress.

391
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,242
So, I'm really sorry that I have
to go, but let's keep at this.

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,923
Okay_
Okay?

393
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,007
Jim!

394
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,121
Thanks.

395
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,847
All right,
have a good trip.

396
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,921
Bye.
Bye.

397
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,961
Hey-

398
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,367
I...

399
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,165
"Love suffers
long and is kind.

400
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,326
"It is not proud.

401
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,763
"Love bears all things,

402
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,209
"believes all things,

403
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,167
"hopes all things,
and endures all things.

404
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,844
"Love never fails.

405
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,921
"And now these three remain.

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,810
"Faith, hope, and love.

407
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,361
"But the greatest
of these is love."

408
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,088
I love you.
I love you.
