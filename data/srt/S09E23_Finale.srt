1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,447
The documentary series
finished airing ages ago.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,363
Why is PBS
sending another crew?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,568
We're getting
bonus footage for the DVD.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,127
Nobody buys DVDs anymore.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,685
It'll be a pledge gift.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,769
PBS. The propaganda wing
of Bill and Melinda Gates,

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,683
and viewers like you.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,364
In the past year,
I've consolidated

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,204
the entire
Scranton paper market.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,521
We regained the White Pages,
the School District,

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,682
Lackawanna County,
we supply them all.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,808
I'm getting married
tomorrow afternoon.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,848
And in the morning,
there's a mini-reunion,

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,288
a kind of a where-are-they-now?
panel at a local theater.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,721
It will be nice to see everyone again.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,280
I haven't seen Kevin
since we let him go.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,161
Today marks several
important milestones.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,403
Stanley, as you know,
is retiring.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,721
Ah!

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,724
I've been looking forward to this
day since I was 18 years old.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,245
Speech!
No.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,881
And our next and most
thickly frosted cake

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,685
is for Kevin.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,569
Yes!

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,846
Wait, why?

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,491
Go ahead and just
read the frosting.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,922
"Get out"?
What does that mean?

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,606
It's a colloquial way of
saying you're fired, Kevin.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,250
- Which you are.
- What?

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,890
Dwight,
you can't do that.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,689
The cake has
spoken, Pam. Sorry.

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,163
Well, if anyone here can make
a case for Kevin staying...

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,971
Based on his merit.

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,681
Oh.

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,481
Um...

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,480
I'm good.

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,050
Well,
Toby will stop it.

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,124
Any time anyone's ever been
fired, Toby's blocked it, so...

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,611
Yeah. Yeah,
I don't think...

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,648
Toby, wait, wait.
Hold that thought.

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,851
Here's your cake.

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,320
Bye, bye, TOW-

43
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,448
At least I got chocolate.

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,285
I bike to work now.

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,328
It saves on gas, it's
cheaper than a vasectomy,

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,721
and, oh, yeah, it's good
for the environment, too.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,407
Pam and I are great.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,371
She just recently finished her mural
for the Irish Cultural Center.

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,047
Can you clap?
Can you clap for Mommy?

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,602
And Dwight is imitating
Japanese business practices,

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,082
for reasons he
explained to us in Japanese.

52
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,209
Angela, are you
ready for the wedding?

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,327
Yes.

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,371
My heart is so open.
I'm so at peace.

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,281
Ugh. Look at Meredith.
She's disgusting.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,849
Those feet. They're like
the paws of an orangutan.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,410
I think she looks good.

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,891
Now that she's
wearing sports bras,

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,246
we don't see
her boobs as much.

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,921
That is all.
Have a good morning.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,126
Thank you.

62
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,803
What was that for?

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,201
To remind you that our Wedding's
going to be wonderful.

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,321
Oh, I know.

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,291
It just feels so empty with
so many of the old gang gone.

66
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,402
D, it's going to be perfect.

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,324
The only people that need
to be there are you and me.

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,925
Oh, and the old man to
feed us the cheese

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,724
that he's been fermenting
since the day of my birth.

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,086
You keep forgetting
about him.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,764
I don't know why.

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,482
I brought in some
new faces, and one old.

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,289
I always liked Devon.

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,442
I hired him back after
Creed faked his own death

75
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,443
in the baler the day
after the doc aired.

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,763
The only person he fooled was Kevin.
Then the police showed up.

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,209
Turns out Creed was in the band
The Grass Roots, in the 1960s.

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,727
During that time,
the police say he sold drugs.

79
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,485
And trafficked in
endangered species meat.

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,882
And stole weapons-grade
LSD from the military.

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,087
Some fudge?

82
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,123
Oh, thanks.
I love your fudge.

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,247
Mmm!

84
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,288
I think I've gained a couple
of pounds since I got here.

85
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,044
You can afford it.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,571
After 16 years,
it's strange sitting across

87
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,563
from somebody
who isn't Stanley.

88
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,042
But
he'll get there.

89
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,964
Okay, the limo's going to
be here at 5:00.

90
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,042
I need everybody to be ready,
because I want to pack in a lot.

91
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,724
Party time,
whorehouse.

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,962
No. No whorehouse.
This is Dwight's night. Okay?

93
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,724
Well, you're
the bestisch Mensch.

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,202
Dwight has made me
his bestisch Mensch,

95
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,806
which is Schrute
for "best man."

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,042
He is putting himself
entirely in my hands tonight,

97
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,408
and I know, for over 12 years, I've
done nothing but trick and prank him.

98
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,925
But tonight?

99
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,563
Only good surprises.

100
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,407
"Guten pranken . "

101
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,562
Oh, hey, Jim, I forgot
to mention, often times

102
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,689
in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor
parties, there are accidental murders.

103
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,489
That won't be
necessary tonight.

104
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,324
Great, now we've got
three hours to fill.

105
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,880
Okay, hold on. Are you sure
Mose isn't going to show up?

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,325
Ever since
Angela moved in,

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,129
and Mose had to stop sleeping
at the foot of my bed,

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,567
he's been acting pretty weird
about this whole wedding thing.

109
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,650
Mose has been weird?
That's so unlike him.

110
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,969
Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it.
Why not?

111
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,044
America's Next A Cappella
Sensation aired my audition,

112
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,441
and when I started
sobbing uncontrollably,

113
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,729
apparently, that struck a chord
with quite a lot of people.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,287
Not a very
compassionate chord.

115
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,531
The clip went viral,
as they say.

116
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,530
You can't just
sit here and cry.

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,206
I can so just
sit here and cry!

118
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,410
Two million hits in the first week,
and then the parodies started.

119
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,000
One from the Philippines
got 12 million hits.

120
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,964
And the late night comedy guys
had a field day with it.

121
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,525
Aw, come on, Baby Wawa.
Don't be such a baby.

122
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,289
Oh, no.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,369
It's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.

124
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,131
For Weekend Update, I'm Seth Meyers!
That's Baby Wawa! Good night!

125
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,244
After my clip blew up, I actually got
a call from the Double Rainbow guy

126
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,163
and the fat Star Wars kid.

127
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,607
Turns out they
have a support group.

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,605
Not really my scene.

129
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,201
Years ago,
the senator promised

130
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,567
a left-turn
lane by the Arby's.

131
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,530
So I want to know where in the
name of horsey-sauce is it?

132
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,120
Well, yeah, you...
Hold on.

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,922
Hi. I keep seeing this symbol
in the accounts from last year.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,571
It's all over the place.
I don't know what it means.

135
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
That's the reason
Kevin got fired.

136
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,649
It's his magic number. He used to
use it to balance his accounts.

137
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,131
He used to call
it a "keleven."

138
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,205
He told Dwight, "A mistake plus
keleven gets you home by 7:00."

139
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,044
He was home
by 4:45 that day.

140
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,885
Oh, I live in Poland now.

141
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,327
The Scranton of the EU.

142
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,805
Thank you for flying me
out here for the weekend.

143
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,281
I'm looking forward
to the reunion panel tomorrow.

144
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,289
Can't wait to see everyone.

145
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,448
Well, almost everyone.

146
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,807
Hello! Hello!

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,681
Oh.

148
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,888
Hi! Oh.
No.

149
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,810
How did you know
my plane had arrived?

150
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,484
How long have you
been stalking me?

151
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,803
No, no, no. My flight just
got in from New York.

152
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,881
Are you still
with Pyotr?

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,446
No, and I thought
I unfriended you.

154
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,171
Anyone can follow
a Twitter feed.

155
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,401
Want to share a cab?

156
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,726
After Dwight fired me,
I moved to New York

157
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,326
to write
the Great American Novel.

158
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,051
I have six roommates,

159
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,043
which are better
than friends, you know,

160
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,522
because they have to give you one
month's notice before they leave.

161
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,766
Hey-o!

162
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,001
Andy?

163
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,445
You're back?
Yeah.

164
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,364
That's Baby Wawa, right?
Oh, my God.

165
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,290
Hey, man,
good to see you.

166
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,771
Thank you. Yeah.

167
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,410
HSy_ Andy“.

168
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,288
Aw. A bear hug from
my favorite mama grizzly.

169
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,569
Andy, I've been worried about you.
How are you?

170
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,491
Little warm.

171
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,403
Poor, poor Andy.

172
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,801
Aw. Thank you, Phyllis.

173
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,166
Hello, hello.
Hey!

174
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,241
Darryl!

175
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,321
Hey!

176
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,481
Hey, what's up?

177
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,767
Didn't I just see you at the
airport, jumping into a limo?

178
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,084
What? Must've been another devilishly
handsome debonair individual.

179
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,288
Hey, man.
How you doing?

180
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,442
I didn't call 'cause I figured
you changed your number.

181
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,490
No, I didn't change the number.
All good, though.

182
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,721
Phone never rings.

183
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,689
What? AW.

184
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,966
Surprise!

185
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,166
Ithoughtyou
guys couldn't come!

186
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,561
Yeah, but then they moved the
panel to the same weekend

187
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,723
and the doc crew paid to fly us in.
It was kismet.

188
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,131
Kismet?

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,922
Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with
excuses for every other weekend.

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,446
You remember my two
Lap-Band surgeries, right?

191
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,885
Neither do I.

192
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,201
Guten prank number one.

193
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,930
You ready for tonight?
We going to tear up the town?

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,162
Uh, you better ask Jim.

195
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,368
And Jim
will say nothing.

196
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,647
Darryl! Andy!

197
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,563
Hey, Pam!
Hey, Pam!

198
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,687
How are you?

199
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,761
We're fine.

200
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,330
Yeah!

201
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,604
And I'm sure that you guys are fine,
too, because why wouldn't you be?

202
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,681
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,366
Darryl, oh, my gosh,
how is Austin?

204
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,965
Tell me everything.
How's the merger?

205
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,565
I feel like I read
aboutAthlead all the time.

206
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,407
I love it. And it's Athleap now.
And the city is amazing.

207
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,845
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.

208
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,689
It's hot,
the music is awesome,

209
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,001
and the tacos are for real.

210
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,646
Wow.
That sounds incredible.

211
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,610
Oh, guys, the limo's here.

212
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,802
Let's do this.
Change if you need to.

213
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,689
Okay, you guys,
have fun!

214
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,050
You, too, Andy.

215
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,000
Whoa!

216
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,320
Oh, ho!

217
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,569
Haven't been in one
of these in forever.

218
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,325
They wanted me to go to the
bachelorette party with the girls.

219
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,641
Really? Such a cliché.

220
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,085
I'm a man.

221
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,443
So, I'm going to the bachelor
party with the boys.

222
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,490
I just have to remember how
I acted before I came out.

223
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,409
VVazzup!

224
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,849
Hey, why are we stopping? Jim,
this isn't on the itinerary.

225
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,880
Jim?
Get out!

226
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,246
Come on!

227
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,728
What, are you
going to whack me, Jim?

228
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,325
No, Dwight.

229
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,129
You'll be doing
the whacking.

230
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,370
A bazooka.
You remembered.

231
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,010
Of course I did.

232
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,965
Get out of my way.

233
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,081
Whoa!

234
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,202
Guten prank number two.

235
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,322
Private room!
Yeah, brocephus!

236
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,765
Amazing!

237
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,126
Enjoy, eHJOY-

238
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,044
Hey, I know you. You going
to sit here and cry?

239
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,804
Okay, man. Easy.

240
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,283
Hey, dude, leave him alone.
What are you doing?

241
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,646
Jim, it's fine.

242
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,644
He'll just get you on his cell
phone and then that will go viral.

243
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,401
That happens a lot?

244
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,087
Yeah, I guess, but things
are going well, actually.

245
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,050
I spoke at Cornell
during Commencement week.

246
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,807
Well, I mean, the seniors invited me
as a joke, but it was a huge success.

247
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,131
Well, I bet
it was a smash.

248
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,123
That's how I got my new job
in the Admissions Office.

249
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,328
Is that
a volunteer program, or...

250
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,528
No, it's a job.

251
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,729
Things are going great!

252
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,921
Let's get
a drink in you, huh?

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,047
Yes!

254
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,961
Whoo-hoo!

255
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,929
Let's get this party started!

256
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,126
Where's my angel?

257
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,844
This is my big sister,
Rachael.

258
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,810
No, this is my
big sister, Angela.

259
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,890
We're very close. We even have
our own special language.

260
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,046
ANGELA". People love it.

261
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,201
They do.

262
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,927
Man, how long have
we been sitting here?

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,206
Hi. boys!

264
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,521
Here we go!

265
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,443
Oh, thank God.
We are famished.

266
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,445
Hey, did somebody
order the chef's special?

267
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,885
Right there.
Right here.

268
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,246
No, we haven't
ordered anything.

269
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,845
No one's even
taken our drinks.

270
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,247
Uh, what is the chef's special?

271
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,211
I bet you boys
have a big appetite.

272
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,244
Oh, we do.

273
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,727
So we'll have an onion loaf
for the table, please.

274
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,002
And tell us about
your heartiest soups.

275
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,326
Ooh, I know what you want.
I know exactly what you want.

276
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,802
Yes, an onion loaf for the table.
But that's not all.

277
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,565
Now the chef's special sounded
good, what is it exactly?

278
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,165
Shh.

279
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,321
Wait,
what are you doing?

280
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,209
Are you giving me a taste
of the chef's special?

281
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,691
Mmm.
Mmm?

282
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,570
It tastes like cigarettes.
That won't work.

283
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,440
That's no good.

284
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,961
Whoo!
What?

285
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,680
Hey, oh, boy!

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,047
Oh.

287
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,202
Heard you guys needed some pipes
fixed, or cleaned, or whatever?

288
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,487
Angela, special
repairman is here!

289
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,840
What is this?

290
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,207
Shut up! Jakey?

291
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,531
Mom?

292
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,840
Wait, Wait. What?

293
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,081
Oh, man.

294
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,970
No, no, no. Just do your work.
Pretend Mom's not here.

295
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,883
Uh, that seems
inappropriate.

296
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,247
Give them a good show,
my little entrepreneur.

297
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,210
- Okay.
- Take it off.

298
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,363
Yeah!
Good song choice, Jakey!

299
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,602
Stripper's only
as good as his song.

300
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,250
Whoa! Oh!

301
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,727
Oh.

302
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,964
Oh, wowy-wow.

303
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,800
Okay...

304
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,287
Whoo!

305
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,407
Whoo-hoo!

306
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,131
Go, Meredith's
stripper son.

307
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,886
Rachael, are you all right?

308
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,200
I don't know!
I don't know!

309
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,691
Oh, my God!

310
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,808
Be gentle,
Jakey, genfle!

311
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,645
Just one second,
just one second.

312
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,562
If anything,
this is rougher!

313
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,971
Stop it, Meredith!

314
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,963
Sorry! My bad.
Go ahead, Jakey.

315
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,969
Uh, it's okay.
Thank you.

316
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,809
You know what?
You don't have to...

317
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,644
No, no, it's okay.

318
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,925
Now for the last time, I'd like
a side salad with balsamic.

319
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,401
Dwight, for the last time,
she's not a waitress.

320
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,005
You're telling me!

321
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,844
If you want her to leave,
just tip her.

322
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,491
What for? We haven't
even gotten bread yet!

323
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,086
Does anyone want to split
a twice-baked potato?

324
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,130
Do you have those? Those
aren't deep fried, right?

325
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,965
That was interesting.

326
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,248
What was that?
It's just the wind.

327
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,924
Will you lock the door?

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,764
Okay.

329
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,169
It's just the wind, see?
Nothing.

330
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,521
All right, you know? You don't
have to leave the door wide open.

331
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,284
We get it. It's the wind.
Just come and shut the...

332
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,567
Oh, my God!

333
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,602
- Phyllis?
- What's happening?

334
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,089
Oh, man! I never
thought I'd say this

335
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,089
but I think I ate too much bone marrow.

336
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,367
Oh, it's the girls.
Hey, Pam.

337
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,246
What?

338
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,607
Angela's been kidnapped.

339
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,051
Phyllis left the door open

340
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,361
and some freak came
and grabbed her and fled.

341
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,841
Good old Mose!

342
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,843
They think it was Mose.

343
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,571
Oh, great! He's getting into
the spirit of the festivities.

344
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,371
Fantastic! He just
pulled off a Braut entfUhrt.

345
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,601
What is that?

346
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,170
A ceremonial
bridal kidnapping.

347
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,642
He will take the bride
and hide her at a local pub.

348
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,690
And when I find the place,
I have to buy everyone drinks.

349
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,286
Oh, all right!
Oh, Mose!

350
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,407
Wait a minute.

351
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,925
You said the tradition
is for the groom

352
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,202
to search for her,
and it ends at a pub.

353
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,080
So, how about the last pub you'd
ever set foot in in this town?

354
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,481
Great,
which one is that?

355
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,450
Mmm. Hey, driver, why don't
you take us to 3030 Adams?

356
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,921
Is that Mose?

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,048
Yes, it is!

358
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,927
I am here
for my bride.

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,843
Well, first,
buy us a drink!

360
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,605
If you want your
bride, buy us a drink!

361
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,081
If you want your bride,
buy us a drink!

362
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,242
Very well, drinks on me!

363
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,044
Bartender.

364
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,171
Well, well,
well, well, well.

365
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,481
That's six "wells".

366
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,762
Did I get that
number right, Dwight?

367
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,090
I heard you
bought a bar, Kevin.

368
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,448
Yes, I did. This one.

369
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,965
Now, get out.

370
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,651
Why did you
pick this place?

371
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,046
Oh.

372
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,205
You? You did this as a prank.
My own bestisch Mensch.

373
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,964
Nope, not a prank.

374
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,690
I think it's time for you
to bury the hatchet.

375
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,171
Waste of a good hatchet.

376
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,322
Okay, just talk.

377
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,406
Well...

378
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,050
I heard you say
"well" the first time.

379
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,049
I know Dwight
misses Kevin.

380
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,322
I saw him making his portrait
out of a Wooly Willy.

381
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,290
Tomorrow's
his wedding day.

382
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,840
You can't be anything but
happy on your wedding day.

383
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,409
It was nothing personal. It's just
that you were terrible at your job.

384
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,448
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

385
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,887
No, really.
You were terrible at math,

386
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,010
and organization, time
management, personal hygiene.

387
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,809
Your Internet
searches were so filthy

388
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,644
we had to throw
out your computer.

389
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,609
Is that all it Was?

390
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,966
That's it.

391
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,684
Come here.

392
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,605
I missed you, Kevin.

393
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,682
I missed you!

394
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,286
Guten prank.

395
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,441
Yes, Mose.

396
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,522
Guten prank
number three.

397
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,006
You've had your drink.
Now, where's my bride?

398
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,288
Mose? What?

399
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,044
Oh, Mose!

400
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,681
What the is
your problem, you?

401
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,361
- Hey, is Angela coming, or...
- No.

402
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,044
We can't see each other
on our wedding day.

403
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,122
And her legs are still numb
from being in the trunk.

404
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,690
- Right.
- Hey, guys!

405
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,406
Stanley!

406
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,686
How's Florida?

407
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh, great.

408
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,082
Yes, I'm living
in Florida now,

409
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,969
little town
called Florida City,

410
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,202
just on the edge
of the Everglades.

411
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,329
The man who delivered my divorce
papers came by fan boat,

412
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,482
which was kind of fun.

413
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,201
I sit on my porch
all day carving birds.

414
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,169
Am I the only one that's nervous?

415
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,322
How are you doing with this?
Should we have bailed?

416
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,731
No, no. I'm fine.

417
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,641
Doesn't seem like anyone
cares about us anyway.

418
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,926
I guess this was worth being
filmed nonstop for nine years.

419
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,731
I'm sorry, guys.
This is probably on me.

420
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,690
I got hated on pretty hard when
that auto-tune went viral.

421
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,684
Just sit here and cry

422
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,843
Oh, I can so
just sit here and cry

423
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,684
You guys are really mean

424
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,807
It can't end like this

425
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,291
You know
Slept in my car last night

426
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,362
Quit my job
Burned all my bridges

427
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,363
And I did unspeakable things

428
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,364
You're just not good
You're just not good

429
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,885
Are you insane?

430
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,731
You're just not good
You're just not good

431
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,962
Chill out

432
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,644
Just sit here and cry

433
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,041
People actually
dance to this.

434
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,487
It's in my jukebox.

435
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,881
None of the money
goes to Andy, though.

436
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,642
Yeah, people hate you.

437
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,889
I'll go talk to the manager.
Maybe we should just go home.

438
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,649
Hey,
it's Andy Bernard.

439
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,531
How did it feel to see your
lives played out on TV?

440
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,928
It's like seeing a documentary
about how your food is made.

441
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,525
It's kind of disgusting.

442
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,171
You learn a lot, but I didn't
want to know any of it.

443
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,050
With today's modern
surveillance technology,

444
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,886
we are in a constant
state of being watched,

445
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,566
whether it's our government or the
government of other countries,

446
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,324
a.k.a. Google.

447
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,483
You guys are being filmed
way more than we ever were.

448
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,610
Uh, no one recognizes me, but now
all my friends call me Plop.

449
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,569
So, thanks, PBS.

450
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,841
Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last
episode was so romantic.

451
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,161
And I think we'd
all love to know,

452
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,971
Pam, what romantic
thing did you do

453
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,646
to pay Jim back
for leaving Athlead?

454
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,009
Well, I mean, how do you pay back
someone for something like that?

455
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,881
But I don't know.
I'm working on something.

456
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,090
She pays me back every day
just by being my wife,

457
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,571
so, that's fine.

458
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,244
Aw...

459
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,721
Okay-

460
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,371
AH I can say is,
if I had Jim,

461
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,171
he'd have a free pass
to do anything.

462
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,169
I mean if! lucked into that,
he could do anything.

463
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,526
Anything.

464
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,363
I'm sorry,
is there a question?

465
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,200
Uh... No.

466
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,088
Pam, what was
in the teapot letter?

467
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,926
Oh, um, well, you know, I think I
would rather keep that private.

468
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,122
If you've been filmed
for nine years of your life,

469
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,567
there'd be some things that you
just want to keep to yourself.

470
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,610
I hear you.
What did it say?

471
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,364
We're going to move on.
Next question, please.

472
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,681
Do you find that your
life feels pointless

473
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,001
now that nobody's actually
filming you anymore?

474
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,921
Yes.

475
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,485
I want to know how everyone
felt they were portrayed.

476
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,686
Was it accurate?

477
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,728
I've got
a beef with that.

478
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,043
For the first seven years I was
getting my PhD in school psychology

479
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,326
and they didn't show it.

480
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,564
Yes, I was getting hammered,
but, hey, it was college.

481
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,401
I have a question
for Jim and Pam.

482
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,643
Everyone watching sees
how much you love each other

483
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,484
and how you're soul mates.

484
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,602
So, Pam,
how could you doubt that

485
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,648
when Jim moved
to Philadelphia?

486
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,930
Uh, you know what? I actually didn't
handle that move very gracefully,

487
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,369
from not communicating
to being a little selfish...

488
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,091
Listen, um,
I was scared.

489
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,370
You know, I loved what I had
and I didn't want to risk it.

490
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,881
And I think that maybe I did
doubt him a little, too.

491
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,961
Which was wrong because he's
shown me time and again.

492
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,929
But when the documentary
started airing,

493
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,244
people in the street told me that
I had this fairytale romance.

494
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,970
But there were
a lot of times last year

495
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,247
when it did not
feel like a fairytale.

496
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,847
But then it got deeper,
and it got stronger,

497
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,400
and now it's better
than a fairytale.

498
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,202
It's like a long book
that you never want to end,

499
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,524
and you're fine with that because you
just never, ever want to leave it.

500
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,210
Aw...

501
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,964
Like Harry Potter?

502
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,648
Yeah.
Like Harry Potter.

503
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,442
I have
a question for Erin.

504
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,606
Really?

505
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,642
Yes, um, the thing I found most
compelling about the documentary

506
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,007
was your search
for your birth mother.

507
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,561
Thank you.

508
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,044
So, my question is,
um, don't you hate her?

509
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,282
I mean,
I would just imagine

510
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,404
that you are so angry at her
that you would hate her.

511
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,480
Maybe sometimes.
But not like hate-hate.

512
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,968
More just like,
"Mom, I hate you,"

513
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,721
and then she would say,
"Go to your room, young lady,"

514
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,882
and I'd stamp my foot
and run upstairs.

515
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,169
And I have a room,
which is really cool.

516
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,322
And then we'd just
have dinner together.

517
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,082
But I don't know,
I'd have to meet her.

518
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,366
Thanks.

519
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,681
Erin?

520
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,731
Yes?

521
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,206
Um, oh.

522
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,446
Erin.

523
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
Yes, is there
a follow up question?

524
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,961
Mom?

525
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,240
Aw...

526
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,650
Erin, same question,

527
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,006
but about your dad?

528
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,844
Well, this feels
like a good place to stop.

529
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,082
Let's thank all our
wonderful panelists

530
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,322
for being here on this
wonderful panel today.

531
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,322
Next week at
the Scranton Cultural Center,

532
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,370
don't forget, Irish
step dancing semi-finals.

533
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,442
Winning team to Mid-Atlantic.

534
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,763
Where is the basket
for gifts?

535
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,888
Right there, sir.
Okay.

536
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,010
Hi. I'm Dakota.

537
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,320
Jeff Bomondo.

538
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,402
I sell ceramic tile
out of Newark.

539
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,925
My wife's name
is Kathryn.

540
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,480
I can show you my social
security card if it helps.

541
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,287
Ugh!

542
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,600
Look at this mud.

543
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,569
Can you imagine
if I'd worn my Jimmy Choos?

544
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,927
I just saved you
600 bucks, mister.

545
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,963
Thanks for helping out, sweetie.
Mmm-hmm.

546
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,362
Kelly? You're here.

547
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,331
Hey, Ryan!
Hey.

548
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,806
Whose baby is this? Oh, are
you, like, a manny now?

549
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,564
No, this little
guy is mine.

550
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,605
So, I was
dating this girl,

551
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,571
and one day she went out to get a
new charger for her e-cigarette.

552
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,290
Never came back.

553
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,724
Oldest story in the book.

554
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,926
Say hi, Drake.

555
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,923
Drake is your baby's name?
Yeah.

556
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,526
That is an amazing name.
I am obsessed with Drake.

557
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,728
His last album,
it just touched me...

558
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,326
No, Kelly, he is not named after
a hip-hop artist from 2011.

559
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,721
It's Drake, like a mix
of Drew and Blake.

560
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,249
Cool.
Well, he is so cute.

561
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,209
Ravi, check out
this cute baby.

562
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,441
I'm obsessed with him.
Hello.

563
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,002
Ravi's a pediatrician, and some
of his patients are total uggos.

564
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,287
Uh, they're called
premature, sweetie.

565
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,249
Yeah. It's good to
see you again, Ryan.

566
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,404
Can you help me up?
Thanks.

567
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,604
Ooh. Oh!

568
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,364
Oh, boy. Maybe your
heels are too high.

569
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,244
No, my heels
aren't too high.

570
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,971
It's because I spent three
hours in a car trunk.

571
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,771
Thanks for not locking the door
when I asked you to, Phyllis!

572
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,247
Sorry, Phyllis.
You didn't know.

573
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,685
As long as I can
get to the altar.

574
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,001
Oh, I'm going to get
you to that altar.

575
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,690
You can take
that to the bank.

576
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,685
You ready?

577
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,570
You kidding?
I was born ready.

578
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,127
Dwight. Dwight. Dwight.

579
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,770
Um...

580
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,483
I don't know how
to tell you this,

581
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,403
but we have
a little bit of a problem.

582
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,686
Oh, no. What?

583
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,127
The ministerjust told
me that it's tradition

584
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,647
for the bestisch Mensch
to be older than the groom.

585
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,207
Oh, come on. I've never
heard of such a thing.

586
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,567
I haven't heard
of it, obviously.

587
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,086
But I'm out, because I'm
significantly younger than you.

588
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,049
Not, significant
is a big word.

589
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,248
I think...
Well, okay, either way.

590
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,243
Teeny“.
Either way, Dwight,

591
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,923
I can't
be there for you.

592
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,371
I'm sorry.

593
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,361
Jim...

594
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,087
I just really wish there
was something I could do.

595
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,761
Michael.

596
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,404
I can't believe
you came!

597
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,168
That's what she said.

598
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,444
Best prank ever.

599
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,601
Yeah!

600
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,247
As is traditional
to the Schrutes,

601
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,164
the lovers are standing
in their own graves,

602
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,928
as a reminder
that this is the only escape

603
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,331
from what they
are about to do.

604
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,050
See, I get what
they're trying to do,

605
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,963
but why are
the graves so shallow?

606
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,121
"Arise, my love,
my fair one, and come away.

607
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,522
"For lo,
the winter is past,

608
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,922
"the rain is over and gone.

609
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,447
"The time of singing has come,

610
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,606
"and the voice of the turtledove
is heard in our land.

611
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,848
"Let me see your face,

612
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,403
"let me hear your voice,
for your voice is sweet,

613
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,165
"and your face is comely."

614
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,969
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

615
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,205
Release the doves!

616
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,046
Oh.

617
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,326
That's...

618
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,210
That's not...

619
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,810
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much for coming!

620
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,043
Now, please take your
hay bales to the reception.

621
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,360
They'll be
used for seating.

622
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,211
Complimentary hay hooks
are placed along the aisles.

623
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,009
Just stab them on in there.

624
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,129
Everybody!

625
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,846
See, now you
don't owe me anything.

626
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,251
Raw? Raw?

627
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,206
Drake has a bit
of a rash and he's hot.

628
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,361
Oh, no!

629
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,681
I was wondering, could you maybe
examine him for a second?

630
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,041
Oh, yeah. You're not feeling well,
little guy?

631
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,531
Okay, sure.
Um, shall we go inside?

632
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,281
Actually, could you go inside?
I'm feeling a little dehydrated.

633
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,328
I could really use a little
break, have some water.

634
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,890
Are you sure you
don't want to go in?

635
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,760
Ravi, just do it! This baby is burning up!
Isn't this what you live for?

636
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,205
Just, go, go!

637
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,645
Thank you, Ram.
Thank you so much.

638
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,041
This is great for me and for Drake.
Thank you.

639
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,131
I don't know, Ryan. Baby
Drake didn't look so good.

640
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,089
He'll be fine. I let
him suck on a strawberry.

641
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,730
He's allergic,
but he'll get over it fast.

642
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,847
I had to talk to you.

643
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,723
You gave your baby an allergic
reaction just to talk to me?

644
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,322
Michael has so many
pictures of his kids,

645
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,769
he had to get two phones with two
numbers, and he pays two bills.

646
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,449
He's just so happy
to have a family plan.

647
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,651
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

648
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,530
I don't know, I've just always
been really good at dancing.

649
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,203
Is it me?

650
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,524
Is it Nellie?

651
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,807
It's everything.

652
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,685
I missed you.

653
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,525
I missed you, too.

654
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,686
Lots of people think that Stanley
Hudson's a mean old grump.

655
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,444
But
would a grump make this?

656
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,450
It's me.

657
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,850
It's me.

658
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,244
I love you.
I love you, too!

659
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,367
We're going
to be together forever.

660
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,930
We're running
off into the sunset!

661
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,650
I've finally
mastered commitment!

662
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,761
Rules and stuff?

663
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,411
Has anyone seen Ryan?
Or Kelly?

664
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,881
Ooh. Yes. Uh, they left
together a little while ago.

665
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,725
Kelly was hoping that
you would keep the baby

666
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,406
so they can start
a new life together.

667
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,451
Oh, that's it. Here.

668
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,091
Call Child Services
and report an abandoned baby.

669
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,084
They'll find a better parent
than Ryan in no time.

670
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,844
Oh, I don't know.

671
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,490
Um, Kevin, oh,
I can help you with that.

672
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,641
Yeah.

673
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,961
I mean, I can find
someone who will...

674
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,840
Who will love that beautiful
little boy the way he deserves.

675
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,730
Okay. This is better.

676
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,086
Yes, it is.

677
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,446
Hi.

678
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,440
Oh, yes.
Hey.

679
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,366
Yes, it is.
Oh, yes, it is.

680
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,161
If Ryan wants his baby back,
please tell him where to find me.

681
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,967
We'll be
somewhere in Europe.

682
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,366
Won't we?

683
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,682
I feel like all
my kids grew up

684
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,882
and then they
married each other.

685
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,322
It's every parent's dream!

686
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,491
Thank you so much.
Good night.

687
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,090
Good luck.
Really fun.

688
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,565
The doc crew is throwing a big after
party in the warehouse tonight.

689
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,122
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kind of lame.
No offense.

690
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,361
You going, Toby?

691
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,363
Oh, I don't know.
I might turn in early.

692
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,523
It's only 6:00.
Come on, everybody's going.

693
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,523
You have to go, Toby!
Yeah, come on, Tobes!

694
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,806
Come on, Toby.

695
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,245
Yeah, I'll stop by.

696
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,890
There he is.

697
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,131
I need to get
out of this dress.

698
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,770
I got to get
out of this dress.

699
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,091
Oh, I'm sorry, Pam.

700
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,444
What's going on?

701
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,881
Why are you
still here?

702
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
I'm so sorry,
they were an hour late.

703
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,851
No, really,
what's going on?

704
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,285
Okay, Okay-

705
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,884
So this past year
has been really great,

706
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,803
and you've been great,

707
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,721
and I know that you
had to make this choice,

708
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,131
and you had to give
something up for me.

709
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,249
But I never want you to have
to give up anything.

710
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,846
I just thought if I
could get us an offer,

711
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,042
then there wouldn't be
anything standing in our way

712
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,806
and I could come to you
with this big Jim gesture,

713
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,883
and show you all at once
just how much I love you,

714
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,169
and how much I really do
believe in your future.

715
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,251
Sorry, how long have you
been showing the house?

716
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,731
About two months.

717
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,847
That's why
it's so clean.

718
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,967
Yeah.

719
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,921
I mean, you were going
to do this without me?

720
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,326
Well, you bought the house
without telling me,

721
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,290
so I thought I could sell it
without telling you.

722
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,731
Oh, okay.

723
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,326
Where would we go?

724
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,281
Austin, maybe?

725
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,763
I promise you, you don't
have to do this for me.

726
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,763
I'm doing it for us.

727
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,331
- The last...
- Okay, we'll take it.

728
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,481
Hold on one second.

729
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,086
The last few months have
meant the world to me,

730
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,446
and all I care about...
Hold on a second.

731
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,760
Wait, what did
you just say?

732
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,571
We want to
buy your house.

733
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,731
You want to do this?

734
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,006
I want to do this.

735
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,491
You really
want to do this?

736
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,891
I really
want to do this!

737
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,371
Oh, my God!

738
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,325
Hey, Darryl.

739
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,201
What?

740
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,201
Yeah!

741
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,520
All right!

742
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,011
We're so excited.

743
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,326
Cool.

744
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,606
Oh, that's for PBS
executives only.

745
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,446
I had to pledge $50 to my local
PBS station just to get this.

746
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,484
I think your ideas
are fantastic, Oscar.

747
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,210
I'd love to contribute
to your campaign.

748
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,886
Thank you, David.

749
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,523
Uh, could I please
have your attention?

750
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,527
So, a year ago, I got
my first art commission

751
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,648
to paint a mural
for Dunder Mifflin.

752
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,611
And I decided to paint
the history of paper,

753
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,330
which was just
some trees and stuff.

754
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,370
And then someone spray-painted
a bunch of butts on it

755
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,442
and I had to start
from the beginning.

756
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,205
But it all worked
out for the best,

757
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,682
because I think that I've
painted the perfect thing,

758
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,889
which is the history
of us, all of us.

759
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,205
And this is
for you, Jim.

760
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,931
And go ahead!

761
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,487
Everyone, let's take our
picture in front of the mural.

762
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,443
Oh, um, I kind of meant just
everybody from the office.

763
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,165
Very nice.
Just a couple dozen more.

764
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,647
Smiles, everybody, smiles!

765
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,166
All right, that's great. I got enough.
Thank you, everybody.

766
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,406
Let's go.

767
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,004
Okay, I need a drink.

768
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,686
Yeah, we all
need a drink.

769
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,091
What the...

770
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,771
There's only dandelion tea
and raisins in here.

771
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,002
Hey, bottom drawer.

772
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,525
Yes.

773
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,008
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Pam.

774
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,087
Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert
doesn't work here anymore.

775
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,723
I didn't watch
the whole documentary.

776
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,246
After a few episodes,
it was too painful.

777
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,442
I kept wanting
to scream at Pam.

778
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,528
It took me so long to do
so many important things.

779
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,968
It's just hard to accept that I spent
so many years being less happy

780
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,411
than I could have been.

781
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,803
Jim was five feet from my desk and
it took me four years to get to him.

782
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,048
It'd be great if people saw this
documentary and learned from my mistakes.

783
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,363
Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm
really happy now.

784
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,681
But, it would just
make my heart soar

785
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,765
if someone out there saw this
and she said to herself,

786
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,730
"Be strong, trust yourself, love
yourself, conquer your fears.

787
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,167
"Just go after what you want.

788
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,523
"And act fast, because life
just isn't that long."

789
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,687
If there is one thing that I've learned
through this whole experience,

790
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,847
it's that if you film
anybody long enough,

791
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,566
they're going to do
something stupid.

792
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,247
It's only human natural.

793
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,046
Hey, guys.

794
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,691
What about
the honeymoon?

795
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,649
Oh, the honeymoon
can wait until tomorrow.

796
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,131
We wanted to
hang out with you guys.

797
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,522
I mean, when are we all going
to be here together again?

798
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,011
Aw, J, P and D,
the three amigos.

799
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,366
It warms my heart.

800
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,920
Hey, what do you say when I
get back from our honeymoon,

801
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,083
the three of us have a conference
room meeting just for fun?

802
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,844
What is that
meaningful look?

803
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,730
You know what?
Maybe we should talk.

804
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,201
Hey, come here!
You guys need to see this.

805
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,327
What is it?

806
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,970
You're
probably sitting there wondering

807
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,610
what will be your mark?

808
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,330
What will you be known for?

809
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,284
It might surprise you
to learn. ..

810
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,369
I finally feel ready.

811
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,044
Athlead is growing.
Athleap.

812
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,691
And Jim can jump back in
without skipping a beat.

813
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,606
We'll come back to visit, but I think
it's time for us to officially...

814
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,126
No, don't say it. You're fired.
You're both fired.

815
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,248
Dwight, come on.
Don't end on a bad note.

816
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,442
Don't be an idiot.
It's for the severance.

817
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,726
The best that
I can do is one month

818
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,926
for every year
you've been here,

819
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,286
that's the max.

820
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,850
Thanks, Dwight.

821
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,243
And, hey,
if you're ever in Austin...

822
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,564
Oh, right, for what? The art? The music?
The incredible night life?

823
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,886
No, thank you.

824
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,206
But if you're
ever in the area,

825
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,601
you'll always
have a place to stay,

826
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,045
in my barn.

827
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,051
There it is.

828
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,441
Do I get along
with my co-workers?

829
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,171
Well, first of all, I don't
have co-workers anymore.

830
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,730
I have subordinates.

831
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,282
So, have I gotten along
with my subordinates?

832
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,805
Let's see.

833
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,451
My supplier relations rep,
Meredith Palmer,

834
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,090
is the only person I
know who knows how to

835
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,362
properly head bang to Motdrhead.

836
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,450
Oscar Martinez, my accountant,
is now godfather to my son.

837
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,888
Angela Schrute, my former
accountant, is now my wife.

838
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,964
My top salesman, Jim Halpert,
was best man at my wedding,

839
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,688
and office administrator Pamela
Beesly-Halpert is my best friend.

840
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,965
So, yes.

841
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,408
I'd say I have gotten along
with my subordinates.

842
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,642
You might feel sorry for me,

843
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,808
but I actually
feel sorry for you,

844
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,767
because you're about
to leave Cornell!

845
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,569
So say it with me.

846
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,008
Oh, I can so just
sit here and cry!

847
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,242
on, yes!

848
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,969
You did good. Real good.

849
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,929
Thanks, Dad“.
Darryl.

850
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,763
I spent so much of my
time here at Dunder Mifflin

851
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,447
thinking about my old pals,
my college a cappella group.

852
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,443
The weird thing is,

853
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,409
now I'm exactly
where I want to be,

854
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,801
I got my dream
job at Cornell,

855
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,969
and I'm still just thinking
about my old pals,

856
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,361
only now, they're the
ones I made here.

857
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,241
I wish there was a way to know
you're in the good old days

858
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,051
before you've
actually left them.

859
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,408
Someone should
write a song about that.

860
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,485
You take something ordinary,
like a piece of paper.

861
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,045
It's not much.

862
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,284
But if you see
it the right way,

863
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,960
and that's what you did
with this documentary.

864
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,723
But seriously, you made
a nine-year documentary

865
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,770
and you couldn't once
show me doing my origami?

866
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,124
Uh, oh!

867
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,527
I saw a friend today
And it had been a while

868
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,449
And we forgot
each other's names

869
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,168
But it didn't matter
Because deep inside

870
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,410
The feelings still
remained the same

871
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,410
Imagine going back and
watching a tape of your life.

872
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,565
You could see
yourself change

873
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,964
and make mistakes
and grow up.

874
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,851
You could watch
yourself fall in love.

875
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,208
Watch yourself
become a husband.

876
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,009
Become a father.

877
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,609
You guys
gave that to me.

878
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,011
And that's
an amazing gift.

879
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,247
Hey, Jim, remember Flonkerton
when you did Office Olympics?

880
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,087
It was awesome.

881
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,241
Thanks, Phyll.

882
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,209
I still have
my medal from that.

883
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,645
Do you even
have a mattress?

884
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,609
No, but I still
have my medal from that.

885
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,570
Oscar? Oscar?

886
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,043
I think I'm gay.

887
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,290
Why do you say that?

888
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,568
It's just that
I'm so emotional.

889
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,688
You're not gay.
You're not gay.

890
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,250
No, but,
maybe the reason...

891
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,805
You're not gay.

892
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,729
Now the faces that I know

893
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,767
Have that same familiar glow

894
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,850
I think I must have known
them Somewhere once before

895
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,246
How did you do it?

896
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,891
How did you capture
what it was really like?

897
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,089
How we felt, and how we
made each other laugh,

898
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,289
and how we got through the day.
How did you do it?

899
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,242
Also how do cameras work?

900
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,041
Every day when I came to work,
all I wanted to do was leave.

901
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,205
So why in the world does it feel
so hard to leave right now?

902
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,408
It all seems
so very arbitrary.

903
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,566
Iapphed for a job at this company
because they were hiring.

904
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,883
I took a desk at the back
because it was empty.

905
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,966
But no matter how you
get there or where you end up,

906
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,561
human beings have this miraculous
gift to make that place home.

907
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,164
Let's do this.

908
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,842
I just feel lucky that I got a
chance to share my crummy story

909
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,968
with anyone out
there who thinks

910
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,010
they're the only one to take
a dump in a paper shredder.

911
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,651
You're not alone, sister.

912
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,210
Let's get a beer sometime.

913
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,401
I'm happy that
this was all filmed,

914
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,450
so I can remember everyone
and what we did.

915
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,087
I worked for a paper
company all these years,

916
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,242
and I never
wrote anything down.

917
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,366
I sold paper at this
company for 12 years.

918
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,966
My job was to speak
to clients on the phone

919
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,283
aboutquanfifies
and types of copier paper.

920
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,806
Even if I didn't love
every minute of it,

921
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,171
everything I have,
I owe to this job.

922
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,445
This stupid,
wonderful, boring,

923
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,570
amazing job.

924
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,087
I thought it was weird when you
picked us to make a documentary,

925
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,689
but all in all,

926
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,962
I think an ordinary paper
company like Dunder Mifflin

927
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,361
was a great subject
for a documentary.

928
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,924
There's a lot of beauty
in ordinary things.

929
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,844
Isn't that kind of the point?
